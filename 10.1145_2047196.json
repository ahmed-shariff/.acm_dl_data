        "abstract": "We present TapSense, an enhancement to touch interaction that allows conventional surfaces to identify the type of object being used for input. This is achieved by segmenting and classifying sounds resulting from an object's impact. For example, the diverse anatomy of a human finger allows different parts to be recognized including the tip, pad, nail and knuckle - without having to instrument the user. This opens several new and powerful interaction opportunities for touch input, especially in mobile devices, where input is extremely constrained. Our system can also identify different sets of passive tools. We conclude with a comprehensive investigation of classification accuracy and training implications. Results show our proof-of-concept system can support sets with four input types at around 95% accuracy. Small, but useful input sets of two (e.g., pen and finger discrimination) can operate in excess of 99% accuracy."

But despite their general use, very little is known about them. We present EchoMouse, a device we created to characterize the transfer functions of any system, and libpointing, a toolkit that we developed to replicate and compare the ones used by Windows, OS X and Xorg. We describe these functions and report on an experiment that compared the default one of the three systems. Our results show that these default functions improve performance up to 24% compared to a unitless constant CD gain. We also found significant differences between them, with the one from OS X improving performance for small target widths but reducing its performance up to 9% for larger ones compared to Windows and Xorg. These results notably suggest replacing the constant CD gain function commonly used by HCI researchers by the default function of the considered systems."

In order to study the feasibility of the force gestures on a mobile touch screen, we implemented a prototype touch screen device that can sense the normal and tangential forces of a touch gesture on the screen.

We conducted a user study with the prototype and the applications to study the characteristics of the force gestures and the effectiveness of their mapping to the primary actions. In the user study we could also discover interesting usability issues and collect useful user feedback about the force gestures and their mapping to GUI actions."

FingerFlux lets users feel the interface before touching, and can create both attracting and repelling forces. This enables applications such as reducing drifting, adding physical constraints to virtual controls, and guiding the user without visual output. We show that users can feel vibration patterns up to 35 mm above our table, and that FingerFlux can significantly reduce drifting when operating on-screen buttons without looking."

Like prior systems in this area, Vermeer provides viewpoint-corrected, stereoscopic 3D graphics to simultaneous users, 360\u00b0 around the display, without the need for eyewear or other user instrumentation. Our goal is to over-come an issue inherent in these prior systems which - typically due to moving parts - restrict interactions to outside the display volume. Our system leverages a known optical illusion to demonstrate, for the first time, how users can reach into and directly touch 3D objects inside the display volume. Vermeer is intended to be a new enabling technology for interaction, and we therefore describe our hardware implementation in full, focusing on the challenges of combining this optical configuration with an existing approach for creating a 360\u00b0 viewable 3D display. Initially we demonstrate direct involume interaction by sensing user input with a Kinect camera placed above the display. However, by exploiting the properties of the optical configuration, we also demonstrate novel prototypes for fully integrated input sensing alongside simultaneous display. We conclude by discussing limitations, implications for interaction, and ideas for future work."

While various shape displays have been proposed, a common approach utilizes an array of linear actuators to form 2.5D surfaces. Through identifying a set of common interactions for viewing and manipulating content on shape displays, we argue why input modalities beyond direct touch are required. The combination of freehand gestures and direct touch provides additional degrees of freedom and resolves input ambiguities, while keeping the locus of interaction on the shape output. To demonstrate the proposed combination of input modalities and explore applications for 2.5D shape displays, two example scenarios are implemented on a prototype system."

However, the massive manufacturing base, as well as millions of in-the-wild monitors, means this effect will be common for many years to come. We take an opposite stance, embracing these optical peculiarities, and consider how they can be used in productive ways. This paper discusses how a special palette of colors can yield visual elements that are invisible when viewed straight-on, but visible at oblique angles. In essence, this allows conventional, unmodified LCD screens to output two images simultaneously - a feature normally only available in far more complex setups. We enumerate several applications that could take advantage of this ability."

Only the depth data from Kinect is used to track the 3D pose of the sensor and reconstruct, geometrically precise, 3D models of the physical scene in real-time. The capabilities of KinectFusion, as well as the novel GPU-based pipeline are described in full. Uses of the core system for low-cost handheld scanning, and geometry-aware augmented reality and physics-based interactions are shown. Novel extensions to the core GPU pipeline demonstrate object segmentation and user interaction directly in front of the sensor, without degrading camera tracking or reconstruction. These extensions are used to enable real-time multi-touch interactions anywhere, allowing any planar or non-planar reconstructed physical surface to be appropriated for touch."

        "abstract": "Computer Aided Design (CAD) typically involves tasks such as adjusting the camera perspective and assembling pieces in free space that require specifying 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). The standard approach is to factor these DOFs into 2D subspaces that are mapped to the x and y axes of a mouse. This metaphor is inherently modal because one needs to switch between subspaces, and disconnects the input space from the modeling space. In this paper, we propose a bimanual hand tracking system that provides physically-motivated 6-DOF control for 3D assembly. First, we discuss a set of principles that guide the design of our precise, easy-to-use, and comfortable-to-use system. Based on these guidelines, we describe a 3D input metaphor that supports constraint specification classically used in CAD software, is based on only a few simple gestures, lets users rest their elbows on their desk, and works alongside the keyboard and mouse. Our approach uses two consumer-grade webcams to observe the user's hands. We solve the pose estimation problem with efficient queries of a precomputed database that relates hand silhouettes to their 3D configuration. We demonstrate efficient 3D mechanical assembly of several CAD models using our hand-tracking system."

We demonstrate how to use this approach to make smart clothing and to rapid prototype touch-sensitive objects of arbitrary shape. To accomplish this, we extend time domain reflectometry in three ways: (1) Thin: We demonstrate how to run time domain reflectometry on a single wire. This allows us to touch-enable thin metal objects, such as guitar strings. (2) Modularity: We present a two-pin connector system that allows users to daisy chain touch-sensitive segments. We illustrate these enhancements with 13 prototypes and a series of performance measurements. (3) Deformability: We create deformable touch devices by mounting stretch-able wire patterns onto elastic tape and meshes. We present selected performance measurements."

With the requirements of consumer electronics in mind, we designed an optical 6-DOF tracker where a few photo-sensors can track the position and orientation of an LED cluster. The operating principle of the tracker is basically source localization by solving an inverse problem. We implemented a prototype system for a TV viewing environment, verified the feasibility of the operating principle, and evaluated the basic performance of the prototype system in terms of accuracy and speed. We also examined its application possibility to different environments, such as a tabletop computer, a tablet computer, and a mobile spatial interaction environment."

Photo-plethysmography (PPG) is one approach; it can collect data from the finger tips that indicate the user's autonomic nervous system (ANS) and offers new potentials such as mental stress measurement and drowsy state detection. Our goal is to set PPG sensors on the surfaces of ordinary devices such as mice, smartphones, and steering wheels. This will offer smart monitoring without the burden of additional wearable sensors. Unfortunately, current PPG sensors are very narrow, and even if the sensor is attached to the surface of a device, the user is forced to align and hold the finger to the sensor point, which degrades device usability. To solve this problem, we propose an area-based sensing method that relaxes the alignment requirement. The proposed method uses two thin acrylic plates, a diffuser plate and a detection plate, as an IR waveguide. The proposed method can yield very thin sensing surfaces and gentle curvatures are possible. An experiment compares the proposed method to the conventional point-sensor in terms of LF/HF discrimination performance with the participant in the resting state, and the proposed method is shown to offer comparable sensing performance with superior usability."

Six LEDs in the module emit IR light in six orthogonal directions, and six corresponding photosensors measure the reflected light energy. One can easily convert almost any soft object into a touch-input device that can detect both touch position and surface displacement by embedding multiple FuwaFuwa sensor modules in the object. A variety of example applications illustrate the utility of the FuwaFuwa sensor module. An evaluation of the proposed deformation measurement technique confirms its effectiveness."

Two user studies determine how users can interact precisely with their forearms and how users behave when operating in their arm space. According to those results, normal users can divide their arm space at most into 6 points between their wrists and elbows with iterative practice. Experimental results also indicate that the divided pattern of each user is unique from that of other ones. Based on the design principles from the observations, an interaction system, PUB, is designed to demonstrate how interaction design benefits from those findings. Two scenarios, remote display control and mobile device control, are demonstrated through the UltraSonic device attached on the users' wrists to detect their tapped positions."

        "abstract": "Projector phones, handheld game consoles and many other mobile devices increasingly include more than one display, and therefore present a new breed of mobile Multi-Display Environments (MDEs) to users. Existing studies illustrate the effects of visual separation between displays in MDEs and suggest interaction techniques that mitigate these effects. Currently, mobile devices with heterogeneous displays such as projector phones are often designed without reference to visual separation issues; therefore it is critical to establish whether concerns and opportunities raised in the existing MDE literature apply to the emerging category of Mobile MDEs (MMDEs). This paper investigates the effects of visual separation in the context of MMDEs and contrasts these with fixed MDE results, and explores design factors for Mobile MDEs. Our study uses a novel eye-tracking methodology for measuring switches in visual context between displays and identifies that MMDEs offer increased design flexibility over traditional MDEs in terms of visual separation. We discuss these results and identify several design implications."

        "abstract": "Language is a subtle and powerful tool for communication. But the words we use also provide a rich mine of information for the social scientist. The history of words like \"ketchup\", \"ceviche\", or \"dessert\" tells us about the relationships between the superpowers who dominated the globe 500 or 1000 years ago. The words on the back of potato chip packages can demonstrate popular attitudes toward social class. And the names we give ice cream flavors may be an evolutionary reflex of the attempt by early mammals to appear larger than their competitors. The language of dating is just as informative as the language of food. In experiments with speed dating, work in our lab shows that we can detect flirtation or other stances in men and women on dates, just by looking at linguistic features like their pitch, their use of negative words like \"can't\" or \"don't\", or how often they use hedges like \"sort of\" or \"kind of\". The language of these two popular topics of conversation, food and dating, can teach us a lot about history, culture, and psychology."

Beyond the shoulder-worn system, there is no instrumentation of the user or environment. Foremost, the system allows the wearer to use their hands, arms and legs as graphical, interactive surfaces. Users can also transiently appropriate surfaces from the environment to expand the interactive area (e.g., books, walls, tables). On such surfaces - without any calibration - OmniTouch provides capabilities similar to that of a mouse or touchscreen: X and Y location in 2D interfaces and whether fingers are \"clicked\" or hovering, enabling a wide variety of interactions. Reliable operation on the hands, for example, requires buttons to be 2.3cm in diameter. Thus, it is now conceivable that anything one can do on today's mobile devices, they could do in the palm of their hand."

This system can make users believe that sound is indeed embedded on the music notes in the scores. The users can play music simply by placing, moving and touching the scores under a desk lamp equipped with a camera and a small projector. By varying the movement, the users can control the playing sound and the tempo of the music. To develop this system, we propose an image processing based framework for retrieving music from a music database by capturing printed music scores. From a captured image, we identify the scores by matching them with the reference music scores, and compute the position and pose of the scores with respect to the camera. By using this framework, we can develop novel types of musical interactions."

Peripheral paced respiration differs from prior techniques in that it does not require the user's full attention. We conducted a within-subjects study to evaluate the efficacy of peripheral paced respiration, as compared to no feedback, in an ecologically valid environment. Participant respiration decreased significantly in the pacing condition. Upon further analysis, we attribute this difference to a significant decrease in breath rate while the intermittent pacing feedback is active, rather than a persistent change in respiratory pattern. The results have implications for researchers in physiological computing, biofeedback designers, and human-computer interaction researchers concerned with user stress and affect."

        "abstract": "Interactive systems often require calibration to ensure that input and output are optimally configured. Without calibration, user performance can degrade (e.g., if an input device is not adjusted for the user's abilities), errors can increase (e.g., if color spaces are not matched), and some interactions may not be possible (e.g., use of an eye tracker). The value of calibration is often lost, however, because many calibration processes are tedious and unenjoyable, and many users avoid them altogether. To address this problem, we propose calibration games that gather calibration data in an engaging and entertaining manner. To facilitate the creation of calibration games, we present design guidelines that map common types of calibration to core tasks, and then to well-known game mechanics. To evaluate the approach, we developed three calibration games and compared them to standard procedures. Users found the game versions significantly more enjoyable than regular calibration procedures, without compromising the quality of the data. Calibration games are a novel way to motivate users to carry out calibrations, thereby improving the performance and accuracy of many human-computer systems."

Most of these charts are only available as bitmap images; without access to the underlying data it is prohibitively difficult for viewers to create more effective visual representations. In response we present ReVision, a system that automatically redesigns visualizations to improve graphical perception. Given a bitmap image of a chart as input, ReVision applies computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify the chart type (e.g., pie chart, bar chart, scatterplot, etc.). It then extracts the graphical marks and infers the underlying data. Using a corpus of images drawn from the web, ReVision achieves image classification accuracy of 96% across ten chart categories. It also accurately extracts marks from 79% of bar charts and 62% of pie charts, and from these charts it successfully extracts data from 71% of bar charts and 64% of pie charts. ReVision then applies perceptually-based design principles to populate an interactive gallery of redesigned charts. With this interface, users can view alternative chart designs and retarget content to different visual styles."

Inspired by natural variations in stroke speed when drawing quickly or with precision, we exploit stroke dynamics to distinguish intentional fine detail from stroke noise. Combining inertia and stroke dynamics, elasticurves can be imagined as the trace of a pen attached to the user by an oscillation-free elastic band. Sketched quickly, the elasticurve spatially lags behind the stroke, smoothing over stroke detail, but catches up and matches the input stroke at slower speeds. Connectors, such as lines or circular-arcs link the evolving elasticurve to the next input point, growing the curve by a responsiveness fraction along the connector. Responsiveness is calibrated, to reflect drawing skill or device noise. Elasticurves are theoretically sound and robust to variations in stroke sampling. Practically, they neaten digital strokes in real-time while retaining the modeless and visceral feel of pen on paper."

Portico thus allows tablets to extend both their sensing capabilities and interaction space without sacrificing portability. We describe the design of our system and present a number of applications that demonstrate Portico's unique capability to track objects. We focus on a number of fun applications that demonstrate how such a device can be used as a low-cost way to create personal surface computing experiences.

PocketTouch enables a rich set of gesture interactions, ranging from simple touch strokes to full alphanumeric text entry. Our prototype device consists of a custom multitouch capacitive sensor mounted on the back of a smartphone. Similar capabilities could be enabled on most existing capacitive touchscreens through low-level access to the capacitive sensor. We demonstrate how touch strokes can be used to initialize the device for interaction and how strokes can be processed to enable text recognition of characters written over the same physical area. We also contribute a comparative study that empirically measures how different fabrics attenuate touch inputs, providing insight for future investigations. Our results suggest that PocketTouch will work reliably with a wide variety of fabrics used in today's garments, and is a viable input method for quick eyes-free operation of devices in pockets."

The sizing of the eight keys is based on users' mental layout of a QWERTY keyboard on an iPad. The system disambiguates the word the user types based on the sequence of keys pressed. The user can use flick gestures to perform backspace and enter, and tap on the bezel below the keyboard to input a space. Through an evaluation, we show that participants are able to quickly learn how to use the 1Line keyboard and type at a rate of over 30 WPM after just five 20-minute typing sessions. Using a keystroke level model, we predict the peak expert text entry rate with the 1Line keyboard to be 66--68 WPM."

        "abstract": "We introduce NaviRadar: an interaction technique for mobile phones that uses a radar metaphor in order to communicate the user's correct direction for crossings along a desired route. A radar sweep rotates clockwise and tactile feedback is provided where each sweep distinctly conveys the user's current direction and the direction in which the user must travel. In a first study, we evaluated the overall concept and tested five different tactile patterns to communicate the two different directions via a single tactor. The results show that people are able to easily understand the NaviRadar concept and can identify the correct direction with a mean deviation of 37\u00b0 out of the full 360\u00b0 provided. A second study shows that NaviRadar achieves similar results in terms of perceived usability and navigation performance when compared with spoken instructions. By using only tactile feedback, NaviRadar provides distinct advantages over current systems. In particular, no visual attention is required to navigate; thus, it can be spent on providing greater awareness of one's surroundings. Moreover, the lack of audio attention enables it to be used in noisy environments or this attention can be better spent on talking with others during navigation."

        "abstract": "People naturally understand and use proxemic relationships (e.g., their distance and orientation towards others) in everyday situations. However, only few ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) systems interpret such proxemic relationships to mediate interaction (proxemic interaction). A technical problem is that developers find it challenging and tedious to access proxemic information from sensors. Our Proximity Toolkit solves this problem. It simplifies the exploration of interaction techniques by supplying fine-grained proxemic information between people, portable devices, large interactive surfaces, and other non-digital objects in a room-sized environment. The toolkit offers three key features. 1) It facilitates rapid prototyping of proxemic-aware systems by supplying developers with the orientation, distance, motion, identity, and location information between entities. 2) It includes various tools, such as a visual monitoring tool, that allows developers to visually observe, record and explore proxemic relationships in 3D space. (3) Its flexible architecture separates sensing hardware from the proxemic data model derived from these sensors, which means that a variety of sensing technologies can be substituted or combined to derive proxemic information. We illustrate the versatility of the toolkit with proxemic-aware systems built by students."

A prototype is implemented with several calibration processes to compensate the differences in headphones and users' tapping actions.

        "abstract": "We propose a method for learning how to use an imaginary interface (i.e., a spatial non-visual interface) that we call \"transfer learning\". By using a physical device (e.g. an iPhone) a user inadvertently learns the interface and can then transfer that knowledge to an imaginary interface. We illustrate this concept with our Imaginary Phone prototype. With it users interact by mimicking the use of a physical iPhone by tapping and sliding on their empty non-dominant hand without visual feedback. Pointing on the hand is tracked using a depth camera and touch events are sent wirelessly to an actual iPhone, where they invoke the corresponding actions. Our prototype allows the user to perform everyday task such as picking up a phone call or launching the timer app and setting an alarm. Imaginary Phone thereby serves as a shortcut that frees users from the necessity of retrieving the actual physical device. We present two user studies that validate the three assumptions underlying the transfer learning method. (1) Users build up spatial memory automatically while using a physical device: participants knew the correct location of 68% of their own iPhone home screen apps by heart. (2) Spatial memory transfers from a physical to an imaginary inter-face: participants recalled 61% of their home screen apps when recalling app location on the palm of their hand. (3) Palm interaction is precise enough to operate a typical mobile phone: Participants could reliably acquire 0.95cm wide iPhone targets on their palm-sufficiently large to operate any iPhone standard widget."

In this paper, we introduce a set of three software-based access overlays intended to improve the accessibility of large touch screen interfaces, specifically interactive tabletops. Our access overlays are called edge projection, neighborhood browsing, and touch-and-speak. In a user study, 14 blind users compared access overlays to an implementation of Apple's VoiceOver screen reader. Our results show that two of our techniques were faster than VoiceOver, that participants correctly answered more questions about the screen's layout using our techniques, and that participants overwhelmingly preferred our techniques.

We describe the challenges in enabling this user experience and our solution, an algorithm that allows two devices to compare imprecisely-entered tap sequences while maintaining the secrecy of those sequences. We also discuss our prototype implementation of RhythmLink and review the results of initial user tests."

In this paper, we present a hybrid framework, PAX, which associates the visual representation of user interfaces (i.e. the pixels) and their internal hierarchical metadata (i.e. the content, role, and value). We identify challenges to building such a framework. We also develop and evaluate two new algorithms for detecting text at arbitrary places on the screen, and for segmenting a text image into individual word blobs. Finally, we validate our framework in implementations of three applications. We enhance an existing pixel-based system, Sikuli Script, and preserve the readability of its script code at the same time. Further, we create two novel applications, Screen Search and Screen Copy, to demonstrate how PAX can be applied to development of desktop-level interactive systems."

For example, a QF-graph for the GIMP graphics manipulation software links the query \"GIMP black and white\" to the commands \"desaturate\" and \"grayscale.\" We demonstrate how QF-graphs can be constructed using search query logs, search engine results, web page content, and localization data from interactive systems. An analysis of QF-graphs shows that the associations produced by our approach exhibit levels of accuracy that make them eminently usable in a range of real-world applications. Finally, we present three hypothetical user interface mechanisms that illustrate the potential of QF-graphs: search-driven interaction, dynamic tooltips, and app-to-app analogy search."

        "abstract": "Current input handling systems provide effective techniques for modeling, tracking, interpreting, and acting on user input. However, new interaction technologies violate the standard assumption that input is certain. Touch, speech recognition, gestural input, and sensors for context often produce uncertain estimates of user inputs. Current systems tend to remove uncertainty early on. However, information available in the user interface and application can help to resolve uncertainty more appropriately for the end user. This paper presents a set of techniques for tracking the state of interactive objects in the presence of uncertain inputs. These techniques use a Monte Carlo approach to maintain a probabilistically accurate description of the user interface that can be used to make informed choices about actions. Samples are used to approximate the distribution of possible inputs, possible interactor states that result from inputs, and possible actions (callbacks and feedback) interactors may execute. Because each sample is certain, the developer can specify most of the behavior of interactors in a familiar, non-probabilistic fashion. This approach retains all the advantages of maintaining information about uncertainty while minimizing the need for the developer to work in probabilistic terms. We present a working implementation of our framework and illustrate the power of these techniques within a paint program that includes three different kinds of uncertain input."

        "abstract": "This paper describes Collabode, a web-based Java integrated development environment designed to support close, synchronous collaboration between programmers. We examine the problem of collaborative coding in the face of program compilation errors introduced by other users which make collaboration more difficult, and describe an algorithm for error-mediated integration of program code. Concurrent editors see the text of changes made by collaborators, but the errors reported in their view are based only on their own changes. Editors may run the program at any time, using only error-free edits supplied so far, and ignoring incomplete or otherwise error-generating changes. We evaluate this algorithm and interface on recorded data from previous pilot experiments with Collabode, and via a user study with student and professional programmers. We conclude that it offers appreciable benefits over naive continuous synchronization without regard to errors and over manual version control."

        "abstract": "Video tutorials provide a convenient means for novices to learn new software applications. Unfortunately, staying in sync with a video while trying to use the target application at the same time requires users to repeatedly switch from the application to the video to pause or scrub backwards to replay missed steps. We present Pause-and-Play, a system that helps users work along with existing video tutorials. Pause-and-Play detects important events in the video and links them with corresponding events in the target application as the user tries to replicate the depicted procedure. This linking allows our system to automatically pause and play the video to stay in sync with the user. Pause-and-Play also supports convenient video navigation controls that are accessible from within the target application and allow the user to easily replay portions of the video without switching focus out of the application. Finally, since our system uses computer vision to detect events in existing videos and leverages application scripting APIs to obtain real time usage traces, our approach is largely independent of the specific target application and does not require access or modifications to application source code. We have implemented Pause-and-Play for two target applications, Google SketchUp and Adobe Photoshop, and we report on a user study that shows our system improves the user experience of working with video tutorials."

        "abstract": "In our field deployments of mobile remote presence (MRP) systems in offices, we observed that remote operators of MRPs often unintentionally spoke too loudly. This disrupted their local co-workers, who happened to be within earshot of the MRP system. To address this issue, we prototyped and empirically evaluated the effect of sidetone to help operators self regulate their speaking loudness. Sidetone is the intentional, attenuated feedback of speakers' voices to their ears while they are using a telecommunication device. In a 3-level (no sidetone vs. low sidetone vs. high sidetone) within- participants pair of experiments, people interacted with a confederate through an MRP system. The first experiment involved MRP operators using headsets with boom microphones (N=20). The second experiment involved MRP operators using loudspeakers and desktop microphones (N=14). While we detected the effects of the sidetone manipulation in our audio-visual context, the effect was attenuated in comparison to earlier audio-only studies. We hypothesize that the strong visual component of our MRP system interferes with the sidetone effect. We also found that engaging in more social tasks (e.g., a getting-to-know-you activity) and more intellectually demanding tasks (e.g., a creativity exercise) influenced how loudly people spoke. This suggests that testing such sidetone effects in the typical read-aloud setting is insufficient for generalizing to more interactive, communication tasks. We conclude that MRP application support must reach beyond the time honored audio-only technologies to solve the problem of excessive speaker loudness."

In our approach, users benefit from well-known 2D metaphors and widgets displayed on a monoscopic touchscreen, while visualizing occlusion-free 3D objects floating above the surface at an optically correct distance. Technically, a horizontal semi-transparent mirror is used to reflect 3D images produced by a stereoscopic screen, while the user's hand as well as a multitouch screen located below this mirror remain visible. By registering the 3D virtual space and the physical space, we produce a rich and unified workspace where users benefit simultaneously from the advantages of both direct and indirect interaction, and from 2D and 3D visualizations. A pilot usability study shows that this combination of technology provides a good user experience."

Our goal is to make tutorials more useful by enabling users to repurpose tutorials between similar applications. We introduce UI translation interfaces which enable users to locate commands in one application using the interface language of another application. Our end-user tool, ShowMeHow, demonstrates two interaction techniques to accomplish translations: 1) direct manipulation of interface facades and 2) text search for commands using the vocabulary of another application. We discuss tools needed to construct the translation maps that enable these techniques. An initial study (n=12) shows that users can locate unfamiliar commands twice as fast with interface facades. A second study showed that users can work through tutorials written for one application in another application."

Triage is a method that temporarily delays the treatment of people with mild to moderate injuries and symptoms and gives priority to those in a critical condition. In the process of multiple triage, more specific information is needed in the second triage compared to the first to accurately prioritize the persons injuries and state. To solve this problem we proposed and constructed a touch-based interface for managing information inserted during second triage. A touch-based tablet interface is introduced to specify wound areas and gestures for wound types. The information is shared wirelessly with all emergency personnel, giving medics shared, data-centric, visibility of overall triage status for the first time. The evaluation experiment shows that this proposed system enables to reduce input errors, speed up injured person care, and facilitate information sharing between medics efficiently. As a result, we believe that many more injured persons can and will be saved."

Designing a successful availability-sharing system requires finding the right balance to optimize the benefits and reduce costs for both the interrupter and interruptee. In this paper, we examine the design space of availability-sharing systems and identify six relevant design dimensions: abstraction, presentation, information delivery, symmetry, obtrusiveness and temporal gradient. We describe these dimensions in terms of the tensions between interrupters and interruptees revealed in previous studies of workplace collaboration and deployments of awareness systems. As a demonstration of the utility of our design space, we introduce InterruptMe, a novel availability-sharing system that represents a previously unexplored point in the design space and that balances the tensions between interrupters and interruptees. InterruptMe differs from previous systems in that it displays availability information only when needed by monitoring implicit inputs from the system's users, implements a traceable asymmetry structure, and introduces the notion of per-communications channel availability."

These cues serve as salient entry points into a browsing interface that enables faceted navigation and rapid skimming of email messages.

While interactive tools can assist data transformation, analysts must still conceptualize the desired output state, formulate a transformation strategy, and specify complex transforms. We present a model to proactively suggest data transforms which map input data to a relational format expected by analysis tools. To guide search through the space of transforms, we propose a metric that scores tables according to type homogeneity, sparsity and the presence of delimiters. When compared to \"ideal\" hand-crafted transformations, our model suggests over half of the needed steps; in these cases the top-ranked suggestion is preferred 77% of the time. User study results indicate that suggestions produced by our model can assist analysts' transformation tasks, but that users do not always value proactive assistance, instead preferring to maintain the initiative. We discuss some implications of these results for mixed-initiative interfaces."

In this paper, we introduce the use of synchronous crowds for on-demand, realtime crowdsourcing. With synchronous crowds, systems can dynamically adapt tasks by leveraging the fact that workers are present at the same time. We develop techniques that recruit synchronous crowds in two seconds and use them to execute complex search tasks in ten seconds. The first technique, the retainer model, pays workers a small wage to wait and respond quickly when asked. We offer empirically derived guidelines for a retainer system that is low-cost and produces on-demand crowds in two seconds. Our second technique, rapid refinement, observes early signs of agreement in synchronous crowds and dynamically narrows the search space to focus on promising directions. This approach produces results that, on average, are of more reliable quality and arrive faster than the fastest crowd member working alone. To explore benefits and limitations of these techniques for interaction, we present three applications: Adrenaline, a crowd-powered camera where workers quickly filter a short video down to the best single moment for a photo; and Puppeteer and A|B, which examine creative generation tasks, communication with workers, and low-latency voting."

Dormouse is designed to enable cross-platform programming languages for social computation, so, for example, programs written for Mechanical Turk can also run on other crowdsourcing platforms. Dormouse also enables a programmer to easily combine crowdsourcing platforms or create new ones. Further, machines and people are both first-class citizens in Dormouse, allowing for natural parallelization and control flows for a broad range of data-intensive applications. And finally and importantly, Dormouse includes notions of real identity, heterogeneity, and social structure. We show that the unique properties of Dormouse enable elegant programming models for complex and useful problems, and we propose two such frameworks. ManReduce is a framework for combining human and machine computation into an intuitive parallel data flow that goes beyond existing frameworks in several important ways, such as enabling functions on arbitrary communication graphs between human and machine clusters. And Dog is a high-level procedural language written on top of ManReduce that focuses on expressivity and reuse. We explore two applications written in Dog: bootstrapping product recommendations without purchase data, and expert labeling of medical images."

Our technique captures behavioral traces from online crowd workers and uses them to predict outcome measures such quality, errors, and the likelihood of cheating. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach across three contexts including classification, generation, and comprehension tasks. The results indicate that we can build predictive models of task performance based on behavioral traces alone, and that these models generalize to related tasks. Finally, we discuss limitations and extensions of the approach."
