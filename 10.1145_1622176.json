One possible solution is to allow end users to train machine learning systems to identify desired concepts, a strategy known as interactive concept learning. A fundamental challenge is to design systems that preserve end user flexibility and control while also guiding them to provide examples that allow the machine learning system to effectively learn the desired concept. This paper presents our design and evaluation of four new overview based approaches to guiding example selection. We situate our explorations within CueFlik, a system examining end user interactive concept learning in Web image search. Our evaluation shows our approaches not only guide end users to select better training examples than the best performing previous design for this application, but also reduce the impact of not knowing when to stop training the system. We discuss challenges for end user interactive concept learning systems and identify opportunities for future research on the effective design of such systems."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}09", "title": "The web page as a {WYSIWYG} end-user customizable database-backed information management application", "author": "David R.

We introduce relaxed selection techniques, in which users implicitly define a level of similarity that can vary across the search pattern, while creating a search query with a single-gesture interaction. Users sketch over part of the graph, establishing the level of similarity through either spatial deviations from the graph, or the speed at which they sketch (temporal deviations).

Our aim is to leverage the space above the surface in combination with the regular tabletop display to allow more intuitive manipulation of digital content in three-dimensions. Our goal is to design a technique that closely resembles the ways we manipulate physical objects in the real-world; conceptually, allowing virtual objects to be 'picked up' off the tabletop surface in order to manipulate their three dimensional position or orientation. We chart the evolution of this technique, implemented on two rear projection-vision tabletops. Both use special projection screen materials to allow sensing at significant depths beyond the display. Existing and new computer vision techniques are used to sense hand gestures and postures above the tabletop, which can be used alongside more familiar multi-touch interactions. Interacting above the surface in this way opens up many interesting challenges. In particular it breaks the direct interaction metaphor that most tabletops afford. We present a novel shadow-based technique to help alleviate this issue.

We also present a study of 10 subjects showing that after they created their own TapSong models from 12 examples (< 2 minutes), their subsequent login attempts were 83.2% successful. Furthermore, aural and visual eavesdropping of the experimenter's logins resulted in only 10.7% successful imposter logins by subjects. Even when subjects heard the target jingles played by a synthesized piano, they were only 19.4% successful logging in as imposters. These results are attributable to subtle but reliable individual differences in people's tapping, which are supported by prior findings in music psychology."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}09", "title": "A screen-space formulation for 2D and 3D direct manipulation", "author": "Jason L.

Because the use of RST has thus far focused almost entirely on 2D, there are not yet standard techniques for extending these principles into three dimensions. In this paper we describe a screen-space method which fully captures the semantics of the traditional 2D RST multi-touch interaction, but also allows us to extend these same principles into three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Just like RST allows users to directly manipulate 2D contexts with two or more points, our method allows the user to directly manipulate 3D objects with three or more points. We show some novel interactions, which take perspective into account and are thus not available in orthographic environments. Furthermore, we identify key ambiguities and unexpected behaviors that arise when performing direct manipulation in 3D and offer solutions to mitigate the difficulties each presents. Finally, we show how to extend our method to meet application-specific control objectives, as well as show our method working in some example environments."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}09", "title": "A reconfigurable ferromagnetic input device", "author": "Jonathan Hook and Stuart Taylor and Alex Butler and Nicolas Villar and Shahram Izadi", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1622176.1622186", "doi": "10.1145/1622176.1622186", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Hook_2009", "abstract": "We present a novel hardware device based on ferromagnetic sensing, capable of detecting the presence, position and deformation of any ferrous object placed on or near its surface.

Although with these representations a user might be able to visually identify elements of sounds in a mixture, they do not facilitate object-specific editing (e.g. selecting only the voice of a singer in a song). This interface uses audio guidance from a user in order to select a target sound within a mixture. The user is asked to vocalize (or otherwise sonically represent) the desired target sound, and an automatic process identifies and isolates the elements of the mixture that best relate to the user's input. This way of pointing to specific parts of an audio stream allows a user to perform audio selections which would have been infeasible otherwise."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 22nd annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}09", "title": "Contact area interaction with sliding widgets", "author": "Tomer Moscovich", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1622176.1622181", "doi": "10.1145/1622176.1622181", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Moscovich_2009", "abstract": "We show how to design touchscreen widgets that respond to a finger's contact area.

These Sliding Widgets resolve selection ambiguity and provide designers with a rich vocabulary of self-disclosing interaction mechanism.

This is especially true for the study of sensory and cognitive illusions, since they represent effects that clearly stand out as not representing the real world. That is, since illusions don't match reality we can know that by studying illusions we are studying exactly what the brain is actually doing, and not just what we think the brain should be doing. Your brain does a staggering amount of pragmatic self-dealing guesswork and outright confabulation in order to construct the highly imperfect mental simulation of reality known as \"consciousness.\" This is not to say that objective reality isn't \"out there\" in a very real sense--but no one lives there. No one's ever even been there for a visit.

Leveraging additional information available on the surfaces could potentially result in richer and novel interactions. In this paper we specifically explore the role of finger orientation. This property is typically ignored in touch-based interactions partly because of the ambiguity in determining it solely from the contact shape. We present a simple algorithm that unambiguously detects the directed finger orientation vector in real-time from contact information only, by considering the dynamics of the finger landing process. Results of an experimental evaluation show that our algorithm is stable and accurate. We then demonstrate how finger orientation can be leveraged to enable novel interactions and to infer higher-level information such as hand occlusion or user position.
