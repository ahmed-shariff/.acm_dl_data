        "abstract": "In this paper we present MechanoBeat, a 3D printed mechanical tag that oscillates at a unique frequency upon user interaction. With the help of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radar array, MechanoBeat can unobtrusively monitor interactions with both stationary and mobile objects. MechanoBeat consists of small, scalable, and easy-to-install tags that do not require any batteries, silicon chips, or electronic components. Tags can be produced using commodity desktop 3D printers with cheap materials. We develop an efficient signal processing and deep learning method to locate and identify tags using only the signals reflected from the tag vibrations. MechanoBeat is capable of detecting simultaneous interactions with high accuracy, even in noisy environments. We leverage UWB radar signals' high penetration property to sense interactions behind walls in a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenario. A number of applications using MechanoBeat have been explored and the results have been presented in the paper."

        "abstract": "The development of new hardware can be split into two phases: prototyping and production. A wide variety of tools and techniques have empowered people to build prototypes during the first phase, but the transition to production is still complex, costly and prone to failure. This means the second phase often requires an up-front commitment to large volume production in order to be viable. I believe that new tools and techniques can democratize hardware production. Imagine \"DevOps for hardware\" - everything from circuit simulation tools to re-usable hardware test jig designs; and from test-driven development for hardware to telepresence for remote factory visits. Supporting low volume production and organic scaling in this way would spur innovation and increase consumer choice. I encourage the UIST community to join me in pursuit of this vision."

        "abstract": "Programming-by-example (PBE) has become an increasingly popular component in software development tools, human-robot interaction, and end-user programming. A long-standing challenge in PBE is the inherent ambiguity in user-provided examples. This paper presents an interaction model to disambiguate user intent and reduce the cognitive load of understanding and validating synthesized programs. Our model provides two types of augmentations to user-given examples: 1) semantic augmentation where a user can specify how different aspects of an example should be treated by a synthesizer via light-weight annotations, and 2) data augmentation where the synthesizer generates additional examples to help the user understand and validate synthesized programs. We implement and demonstrate this interaction model in the domain of regular expressions, which is a popular mechanism for text processing and data wrangling and is often considered hard to master even for experienced programmers. A within-subjects user study with twelve participants shows that, compared with only inspecting and annotating synthesized programs, interacting with augmented examples significantly increases the success rate of finishing a programming task with less time and increases users? confidence of synthesized programs."

To design and manually craft such joints is difficult and time consuming. Our system facilitates the creation of custom joints by a modeling interface combined with computer numerical control (CNC) fabrication. The design space is a 3D grid of voxels that enables efficient geometrical analysis and combinatorial search. The interface has two modes: manual editing and gallery. In the manual editing mode, the user edits a joint while receiving real-time graphical feedback and suggestions provided based on performance metrics including slidability, fabricability, and durability with regard to the direction of fiber. In the gallery mode, the user views and selects feasible joints that have been pre-calculated. When a joint design is finalized, it can be manufactured with a 3-axis CNC milling machine using a specialized path planning algorithm that ensures joint assemblability by corner rounding. This system was evaluated via a user study and by designing and fabricating joint samples and functional furniture."

Our technique uses a novel application of acoustic time differences of arrival (TDOA) analysis. We adopt a sensor fusion approach by taking both 'surface waves' (i.e., vibrations through surface) and 'sound waves' (i.e., vibrations through air) into analysis to improve sensing resolution. We carefully design a sensor configuration to meet the constraints of a wristband form factor. We built a wristband prototype with four acoustic sensors, two accelerometers and two microphones. Through a 20-participant study, we evaluated the performance of our proposed sensing technique for tap detection and localization. Results show that our system reliably detects taps with an F1-score of 0.9987 across different environmental noises and yields high localization accuracies with root-mean-square-errors of 7.6mm (X-axis) and 4.6mm (Y-axis) across different surfaces and tapping techniques."

MorphSensor builds onto existing sensor module schematics that already define the electronic components and the wiring required to build the sensor. Since MorphSensor maintains the wire connections throughout the editing process, the sensor remains fully functional even when designers change the electronic component layout on the prototype geometry. We detail the MorphSensor editor that supports designers in re-arranging the electronic components, and discuss a fabrication pipeline based on customized PCB footprints for making the resulting freeform sensor. We then demonstrate the capabilities of our system by morphing a range of sensor modules of different complexity and provide a technical evaluation of the quality of the resulting free-form sensors."

We hypothesized that (1) hand movements follow the servo-mechanism model, (2) submovement endpoints form a bivariate Gaussian distribution, thus enabling us to predict the success rate at which a submovement endpoint falls inside the tolerance, and (3) the success rate for a whole trial can be predicted if the number of submovements is known. The cross-validation showed R^2>0.92 and MAE<4.9% for steering and R^2>0.95 and MAE<6.5% for pursuit tasks. These results demonstrate that our proposed model delivers high prediction accuracy even for unknown datasets."

This precision, however, tends to be lost when fabricating on a differ-ent laser cutter, as it is likely to remove more or less mate-rial (aka 'kerf'). We address this with what we call kerf-canceling mechanisms. Kerf-canceling mechanisms replace laser-cut bearings, sliders, gear pairs, etc. Unlike their tradi-tional counterparts, however, they keep working when manufactured on a different laser cutter and/or with different kerf. Kerf-canceling mechanisms achieve this by adding an additional wedge element per mechanism. We have created a software tool KerfCanceler that locates traditional mecha-nisms in cutting plans and replaces them with their kerf-canceling counterparts. We evaluated our tool by converting 17 models found online to kerf-invariant models; we evaluated kerf-canceling bearings by testing with kerf values ranging from 0mm and 0.5mm and find that they perform reliably independent of this kerf."

Being handheld, they create the illusion of holding the scene in a physical container (the display). This has strong benefits for the intuitiveness of 3D interaction: manipulating objects of the virtual scene amounts to physical manipulations of the display. HPCDs have been limited so far to technical demonstrators and experimental tools to assess their merits. However, they show great potential as interactive systems for actual 3D applications. This requires that novel interactions be created to go beyond object manipulation and to offer general-purpose services such as menu command selection and continuous parameter control. Working with a two-handed spherical HPCD, we report on the design and informal evaluations of various interaction techniques for distant object selection, scene scaling, menu interaction and continuous parameter control. In particular, our design leverages the efficient two-handed control of the rotations of the display. We demonstrate how some of these techniques can be assemble in a self-contained anatomy learning application. Novice participants used the application in a qualitative user experiment. Most participants used the application effortlessly without any training or explanations."

        "abstract": "Despite the recent growth in popularity of personal mobility devices (e.g., e-scooters and e-skateboards), they still suffer from limited safety and narrow design form factors, due to their rigid structures. On the other hand, inflatable interfaces studied in human-computer interaction can achieve large volume change by simple inflation/deflation. Inflatable structure also offers soft and safe interaction owing to material compliance and diverse fabrication methods that lead to a wide range of forms and aesthetics. In this paper, we propose poimo, a new family of POrtable and Inflatable MObility devices, which consists of inflatable frames, inflatable wheels, and inflatable steering mechanisms made of a mass-manufacturable material called drop-stitch fabric. First, we defined the basic material properties of a drop-stitch inflatable structure that is sufficiently strong to carry a person while simultaneously allowing soft deformation and deflation for storage and portability. We then implemented an interactive design system that can scan the user's desired riding posture to generate a customized personal mobility device and can add the user's shape and color preferences. To demonstrate the custom-design capability and mobility, we designed several 3D models using our system and built physical samples for two basic templates: a motorcycle and a wheelchair. Finally, we conducted an online user study to examine the usability of the design system and share lessons learned for further improvements in the design and fabrication of poimo."

To achieve such an interface, we propose a vision-based 3D hand pose estimation framework using a wrist-worn camera. The main challenge is the oblique angle of the wrist-worn camera, which makes the fingers scarcely visible. To address this, a special network that observes deformations on the back of the hand is required. We introduce DorsalNet, a two-stream convolutional neural network to regress finger joint angles from spatio-temporal features of the dorsal hand region (the movement of bones, muscle, and tendons). This work is the first vision-based real-time 3D hand pose estimator using visual features from the dorsal hand region. Our system achieves a mean joint-angle error of 8.81 degree for user-specific models and 9.77 degree for a general model. Further evaluation shows that our system outperforms previous work with an average of 20% higher accuracy in recognizing dynamic gestures, and achieves a 75% accuracy of detecting 11 different grasp types. We also demonstrate 3 applications which employ our system as a control device, an input device, and a grasped object recognizer."

Therefore, body-centric peephole interaction has gained considerable attention. To support its practical implementation, we propose OddEyeCam, which is a vision-based method that tracks the 3D location of a mobile device in an absolute, wide, and continuous manner with respect to the body of a user in both static and mobile environments. OddEyeCam tracks the body of a user using a wide-view RGB camera and obtains precise depth information using a narrow-view depth camera from a smartphone close to the body. We quantitatively evaluated OddEyeCam through an accuracy test and two user studies. The accuracy test showed the average tracking accuracy of OddEyeCam was 4.17 and 4.47cm in 3D space when a participant is standing and walking, respectively. In the frst user study, we implemented various interaction scenarios and observed that OddEyeCam was well received by the participants. In the second user study, we observed that the peephole target acquisition task performed using our system followed Fitts? law. We also analyzed the performance of OddEyeCam using the obtained measurements and observed that the participants completed the tasks with suffcient speed and accuracy."

However, effectively performing this debugging requires intimate knowledge about the underlying software and hardware systems-something that the typical deep learning developer may not have. To help bridge this gap, we present Skyline: a new interactive tool for DNN training that supports in-editor computational performance profiling, visualization, and debugging. Skyline's key contribution is that it leverages special computational properties of DNN training to provide (i) interactive performance predictions and visualizations, and (ii) directly manipulatable visualizations that, when dragged, mutate the batch size in the code. As an in-editor tool, Skyline allows users to leverage these diagnostic features to debug the performance of their DNNs during development. An exploratory qualitative user study of Skyline produced promising results; all the participants found Skyline to be useful and easy to use."

        "abstract": "We present CoVR, a novel robotic interface providing strong kinesthetic feedback (100 N) in a room-scale VR arena. It consists of a physical column mounted on a 2D Cartesian ceiling robot (XY displacements) with the capacity of (1) resisting to body-scaled users' actions such as pushing or leaning; (2) acting on the users by pulling or transporting them as well as (3) carrying multiple potentially heavy objects (up to 80kg) that users can freely manipulate or make interact with each other. We describe its implementation and define a trajectory generation algorithm based on a novel user intention model to support non-deterministic scenarios, where the users are free to interact with any virtual object of interest with no regards to the scenarios' progress. A technical evaluation and a user study demonstrate the feasibility and usability of CoVR, as well as the relevance of whole-body interactions involving strong forces, such as being pulled through or transported."

        "abstract": "We present RealitySketch, an augmented reality interface for sketching interactive graphics and visualizations. In recent years, an increasing number of AR sketching tools enable users to draw and embed sketches in the real world. However, with the current tools, sketched contents are inherently static, floating in mid-air without responding to the real world. This paper introduces a new way to embed dynamic and responsive graphics in the real world. In RealitySketch, the user draws graphical elements on a mobile AR screen and binds them with physical objects in real-time and improvisational ways, so that the sketched elements dynamically move with the corresponding physical motion. The user can also quickly visualize and analyze real-world phenomena through responsive graph plots or interactive visualizations. This paper contributes to a set of interaction techniques that enable capturing, parameterizing, and visualizing real-world motion without pre-defined programs and configurations. Finally, we demonstrate our tool with several application scenarios, including physics education, sports training, and in-situ tangible interfaces."

Our approach allows for thin, lightweight, and textile speakers and does not require high voltage as in electrostatic speakers. We show how the speaker can be designed and fabricated and evaluate its acoustic properties as a function of manufacturing parameters (size, turn counts, turn spacing, and substrate materials). The experiment results revealed that we can produce audible sound with a broad frequency range (1.5 kHz - 20 kHz) with the embroidered speaker with a diameter of 50 mm.

While tools like Fritzing offer a simplified visualization of how components and wires are connected, such pictorial depictions of circuits are rare in formal educational materials and the vast bulk of online technical documentation. Electronic schematics are more common but are perceived as challenging and confusing by novice makers. To improve access to schematics, we propose SchemaBoard, a system for assisting makers in assembling and inspecting circuits on breadboards from schematic source materials. SchemaBoard uses an LED matrix integrated underneath a working breadboard to visualize via light patterns where and how components should be placed, or to highlight elements of circuit topology such as electrical nets and connected pins. This paper presents a formative study with 16 makers, the SchemaBoard system, and a summative evaluation with an additional 16 users. Results indicate that SchemaBoard is effective in reducing both the time and the number of errors associated with building a circuit based on a reference schematic, and for inspecting the circuit for correctness after its assembly."

First, we formally define interaction interferences and discuss their causes from behavioral and system-design perspectives. Then, we report the results of a survey examining users' perceptions of the frequency, frustration, and severity of interaction interferences. We also report a controlled experiment, based on state-of-the-art experimental protocols from neuroscience, that explores the minimum time interval, before clicking, below which participants could not refrain from completing their action.

Crosscast then uses these locations and keywords to automatically select relevant photos from online repositories and synchronizes their display to align with the audio narration.

The key to laser cutting our functional mechanisms is the selective cutting and gluing of stacks of sheet material. Designing mechanisms for this workflow is non-trivial, therefore we contribute a set of mechanical primitives that are compatible with our lamination workflow and can be combined to realize advanced mechanical systems. Our software design environment facilitates the process of inserting and composing our mechanical primitives and realizing functional laser-cut objects."

Unlike the common \"sensor sandwich\" approach used in previous work, ZebraSense inherently minimizes the number of sensing elements, which drastically simplifies both sensor construction and its integration into soft goods, while preserving maximum sensor resolution. The experimental evaluation confirmed the validity of our approach and demonstrated that ZebraSense is a reliable, efficient, and accurate solution for detecting user gestures in various dual-sided interaction scenarios, allowing for new use cases in smart apparel, home decoration, toys, and other textile objects."

Although real-time depth data is accessible, its rich value to mainstream AR applications has been sorely under-explored. Adoption of depth-based UX has been impeded by the complexity of performing even simple operations with raw depth data, such as detecting intersections or constructing meshes. In this paper, we introduce DepthLab, a software library that encapsulates a variety of depth-based UI/UX paradigms, including geometry-aware rendering (occlusion, shadows), surface interaction behaviors (physics-based collisions, avatar path planning), and visual effects (relighting, 3D-anchored focus and aperture effects). We break down the usage of depth into localized depth, surface depth, and dense depth, and describe our real-time algorithms for interaction and rendering tasks. We present the design process, system, and components of DepthLab to streamline and centralize the development of interactive depth features. We have open-sourced our software at https://github.com/googlesamples/arcore-depth-lab to external developers, conducted performance evaluation, and discussed how DepthLab can accelerate the workflow of mobile AR designers and developers. With DepthLab we aim to help mobile developers to effortlessly integrate depth into their AR experiences and amplify the expression of their creative vision."

A projected AR system with a mobile device efficiently makes an interactive tabletop. The projected information connected with physical components (e.g. sensors and motors) enables the programming and simulation on the workspace. Physical components are applied from the initial phase of prototyping using an AR plate, and this supports the iterative trial-and-error process by bridging the workflow. A user study shows that WIKA enabled non-experts to create diverse IKA with their ideas. A tangible interaction and projected information enable the iterative and rapid creation. The method that integrates the hardware and software in the physical environment can be applied to other prototyping tools that support the creation of interactive and kinetic elements."

However, virtual worlds need to utilize layouts and organizational schemes that are meaningful to the user and beneficial for data analysis. This paper presents DataHop, a novel visualization system that enables users to lay out their data analysis steps in a virtual environment. With a Filter, a user can specify the modification they wish to perform on one or more input data panels (i.e., containers of points), along with where output data panels should be placed in the virtual environment. Using this simple tool, highly intricate and useful visualizations may be generated and traversed by harnessing a user's spatial abilities. An exploratory study conducted with six virtual reality users evaluated the usability, affordances, and performance of DataHop for data analysis tasks, and found that spatially mapping one's workflow can be beneficial when exploring multidimensional datasets."

When facial muscles move, the contours of the face change from the point of view of the ear-mounted cameras. These subtle changes are fed into a deep learning model which continuously outputs 42 facial feature points representing the shapes and positions of the mouth, eyes and eyebrows. To evaluate C-Face, we embedded our technology into headphones and earphones. We conducted a user study with nine participants. In this study, we compared the output of our system to the feature points outputted by a state of the art computer vision library (Dlib) from a font facing camera. We found that the mean error of all 42 feature points was 0.77 mm for earphones and 0.74 mm for headphones. The mean error for 20 major feature points capturing the most active areas of the face was 1.43 mm for earphones and 1.39 mm for headphones. The ability to continuously reconstruct facial expressions introduces new opportunities in a variety of applications. As a demonstration, we implemented and evaluated C-Face for two applications: facial expression detection (outputting emojis) and silent speech recognition. We further discuss the opportunities and challenges of deploying C-Face in real-world applications."

Rapidly explored face configurations are interactively projected onto this manifold of meaningful expressions. These expressions can then be refined using a 2D embedding of nearby faces, both on and off the manifold. Our validation is fourfold: we show expressive face creation using various devices; we verify that our learnt manifold transcends its training face, to expressively control very different faces; we perform a crowd-sourced study to evaluate the quality of manifold face expressions; and we report on a usability study that shows our approach is an effective interactive tool to author facial expression."

We evaluated Authr with two user studies, which demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of Authr as an interface and the benefits of assistive task allocation methods for designing complex tasks for human-robot teams. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of software tools for authoring human-robot collaborative plans."

        "abstract": "Knowledge work increasingly spans multiple computing surfaces. Yet in status quo user experiences, content as well as tools, behaviors, and workflows are largely bound to the current device-running the current application, for the current user, and at the current moment in time. SurfaceFleet is a system and toolkit that uses resilient distributed programming techniques to explore cross-device interactions that are unbounded in these four dimensions of device, application, user, and time. As a reference implementation, we describe an interface built using SurfaceFleet that employs lightweight, semi-transparent UI elements known as Applets. Applets appear always-on-top of the operating system, application windows, and (conceptually) above the device itself. But all connections and synchronized data are virtualized and made resilient through the cloud. For example, a sharing Applet known as a Portfolio allows a user to drag and drop unbound Interaction Promises into a document. Such promises can then be fulfilled with content asynchronously, at a later time (or multiple times), from another device, and by the same or a different user."

Finger-Fitts Law [4] revised the conventional Fitts? law into a 1D (one-dimensional) pointing model for finger touch by explicitly accounting for the fat finger ambiguity (absolute error) problem which was unaccounted for in the original Fitts? law. We generalize Finger-Fitts law to 2D touch pointing by solving two critical problems. First, we extend two of the most successful 2D Fitts law forms to accommodate finger ambiguity. Second, we discovered that using nominal target width and height is a conceptually simple yet effective approach for defining amplitude and directional constraints for 2D touch pointing across different movement directions. The evaluation shows our derived 2D Finger-Fitts law models can be both principled and powerful. Specifically, they outperformed the existing 2D Fitts? laws, as measured by the regression coefficient and model selection information criteria (e.g., Akaike Information Criterion) considering the number of parameters. Finally, 2D Finger-Fitts laws also advance our understanding of touch pointing and thereby serve as the basis for touch interface designs."

Using this approach, we estimate the user's arrival time to their intended target and redirect their hand to a point within the EHD's spatio-temporally reachable space. We present an evaluation of this framework implemented with a desktop mobile robot in a 2D target selection task, tested at four robot speeds (20, 25, 30 and 35 cm/s).

Gallery-based interfaces provide a way to quickly evaluate examples and explore the space of potential designs, but require systems to predict which designs from a high-dimensional space are the right ones to present to the user. In this paper we present the design adjectives framework for building parameterized design tools in high dimensional design spaces. The framework allows users to create and edit design adjectives, machine-learned models of user intent, to guide exploration through high-dimensional design spaces. We provide a domain-agnostic implementation of the design adjectives framework based on Gaussian process regression, which is able to rapidly learn user intent from only a few examples. Learning and sampling of the design adjective occurs at interactive rates, making the system suitable for iterative design workflows. We demonstrate use of the design adjectives framework to create design tools for three domains: materials, fonts, and particle systems. We evaluate these tools in a user study showing that participants were able to easily explore the design space and find designs that they liked, and in professional case studies that demonstrate the framework's ability to support professional design concepting workflows."

In response, we introduce SimuLearn, a data-driven method that combines finite element analysis and machine learning to create real-time (0.61 seconds) and truthful (97% accuracy) morphing material simulators. We use mesh-like 4D printed structures to contextualize this method and prototype design tools to exemplify the design workflows and spaces enabled by a fast and accurate simulation method.

Information for users' many different criteria needs to be gathered from many different sources into a structure where they can be compared and contrasted. The usefulness of each criterion for differentiating potential options can be opaque to users, and evidence such as reviews may be subjective and conflicting, requiring users to interpret each under their personal context. We introduce Mesh, which scaffolds users to iteratively build up a better understanding of both their criteria and options by evaluating evidence gathered across sources in the context of consumer decision-making. Mesh bridges the gap between decision support systems that typically have rigid structures and the fluid and dynamic process of exploratory search, changing the cost structure to provide increasing payoffs with greater user investment. Our lab and field deployment studies found evidence that Mesh significantly reduces the costs of gathering and evaluating evidence and scaffolds decision-making through personalized criteria enabling users to gain deeper insights from data."

An experienced audio description author will produce content that fits narration necessary to understand, enjoy, or experience the video content into the time available. This can be especially tricky for novices to do well. In this paper, we introduce a tool, Rescribe, that helps authors create and refine their audio descriptions. Using Rescribe, authors first create a draft of all the content they would like to include in the audio description. Rescribe then uses a dynamic programming approach to optimize between the length of the audio description, available automatic shortening approaches, and source track lengthening approaches. Authors can iteratively visualize and refine the audio descriptions produced by Rescribe, working in concert with the tool. We evaluate the effectiveness of Rescribe through interviews with blind and visually impaired audio description users who give feedback on Rescribe results. In addition, we invite novice users to create audio descriptions with Rescribe and another tool, finding that users produce audio descriptions with fewer placement errors using Rescribe."

In this paper we present ElaStick, a variable-stiffness controller that simulates the dynamic response resulting from shaking or swinging flexible virtual objects. This is achieved by dynamically changing the stiffness of four custom elastic tendons along a joint that effectively increase and reduce the overall stiffness of a perceived object in 2-DoF. We show that with the proposed mechanism, we can render stiffness with high precision and granularity in a continuous range between 10.8 and 71.5Nmm/degree. We estimate the threshold of the human perception of stiffness with a just-noticeable difference (JND) study and investigate the levels of immersion, realism and enjoyment using a VR application."

On digital displays, such as the Microsoft Surface Studio, these properties open up a class of techniques that sense and respond to tilt adjustments. Each display posture-whether angled high, low, or somewhere in-between-affords some activities, but not others. Because what is appropriate also depends on the application and task, we explore a range of app-specific transitions between reading vs. writing (annotation), public vs. personal, shared person-space vs. task-space, and other nuances of input and feedback, contingent on display angle. Continuous responses provide interactive transitions tailored to each use-case. We show how a variety of knowledge work scenarios can use sensed display adjustments to drive context-appropriate transitions, as well as technical software details of how to best realize these concepts. A preliminary remote user study suggests that techniques must balance effort required to adjust tilt, versus the potential benefits of a sensed transition."

Based on a user's movement through the physical space, ZoomWall props are coordinated through a predict-and-dispatch architecture to provide just-in-time haptic feedback for objects the user is about to touch. To refine our system, we conducted simulation studies of different prediction algorithms, which helped us to refine our algorithmic approach to realize the physical ZoomWall prototype. Finally, we evaluated our system through a user experience study, which showed that participants found that ZoomWalls increased their sense of presence in the VR environment.

In this way, manual navigation steps are bypassed, and the correction can be committed with a single tap. We solved two critical problems to support JustCorrect: (1) Correction Algorithm: we propose an algorithm that infers the user's correction intention from the last typed word. (2) Input Modalities: our study revealed that both tap and gesture were suitable input modalities for performing JustCorrect. Based on our findings, we integrated JustCorrect into a soft keyboard. Our user studies show that using JustCorrect reduces the text correction time by 12.8% over the stock Android keyboard and by 9.7% over the \"Type, then Correct\" text correction technique by Zhang et al.

We extend the familiar hierarchical block diagram with polymorphism to include abstract-typed blocks (e.g., generic resistor supertype) and electronics modeling (i.e., currents and voltages). Such an approach brings the advantages of reusability and encapsulation from object-oriented programming, while addressing the unique needs of electronics designers such as physical correctness verification. We discuss the system design, including fundamental abstractions, the block diagram construction HDL, and user interfaces to inspect and fine-tune the design; demonstrate example designs built with our system; and present feedback from intermediate-level engineers who have worked with our system."

        "abstract": "The software behind online community platforms encodes a governance model that represents a strikingly narrow set of governance possibilities focused on moderators and administrators. When online communities desire other forms of government, such as ones that take many members? opinions into account or that distribute power in non-trivial ways, communities must resort to laborious manual effort. In this paper, we present PolicyKit, a software infrastructure that empowers online community members to concisely author a wide range of governance procedures and automatically carry out those procedures on their home platforms. We draw on political science theory to encode community governance into policies, or short imperative functions that specify a procedure for determining whether a user-initiated action can execute. Actions that can be governed by policies encompass everyday activities such as posting or moderating a message, but actions can also encompass changes to the policies themselves, enabling the evolution of governance over time. We demonstrate the expressivity of PolicyKit through implementations of governance models such as a random jury deliberation, a multi-stage caucus, a reputation system, and a promotion procedure inspired by Wikipedia's Request for Adminship (RfA) process."

Its simple design comprises a single actuated joint that pivots a haptic handle into and out of the user's hand, rendering the haptic sensations of grasping, catching, or throwing an object anywhere in space. Unlike existing hand-held haptic devices and haptic gloves, PIVOT leaves the user's palm free when not in use, allowing users to make unencumbered use of their hand. PIVOT also enables rendering forces acting on the held virtual objects, such as gravity, inertia, or air-drag, by actively driving its motor while the user is firmly holding the handle. When wearing a PIVOT device on both hands, they can add haptic feedback to bimanual interaction, such as lifting larger objects. In our user study, participants (n=12) evaluated the realism of grabbing and releasing objects of different shape and size with mean score 5.19 on a scale from 1 to 7, rated the ability to catch and throw balls in different directions with different velocities (mean=5.5), and verified the ability to render the comparative weight of held objects with 87% accuracy for ~100g increments."

Existing optical motion capture systems use multiple cameras, which are synchronized and require camera calibration. These systems also have usability constraints that limit the user's movement and operating space. Since the MonoEye system is based on a wearable single RGB camera, the wearer's 3D body pose can be captured without space and environment limitations. The body pose, captured with our system, is aware of the camera orientation and therefore it is possible to recognize various motions that existing egocentric motion capture systems cannot recognize. Furthermore, the proposed system captures not only the wearer's body motion but also their viewport using the head pose estimation and an ultra-wide image. To implement robust multimodal motion capture, we design three deep neural networks: BodyPoseNet, HeadPoseNet, and CameraPoseNet, that estimate 3D body pose, head pose, and camera pose in real-time, respectively. We train these networks with our new extensive synthetic dataset providing 680K frames of renderings of people with a wide range of body shapes, clothing, actions, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. To demonstrate the interactive potential of the MonoEye system, we present several application examples from common body gestural to context-aware interactions."

        "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in 3D printing technology, which allows users to rapidly produce 3D objects, printing tall and/or large objects still consumes more time and large amount of support material. In order to address these problems, we propose Pop-up Print, a method to 3D print an object in a compact \"folded\" state and then unfold it after printing to achieve the final artifact. Using this method, we can reduce the object's print height and volume, which directly affects the printing time and support material consumption. In addition, thanks to the reversibility of folding/unfolding, we can reversibly minimize the printed object's volume when unused for storage or transportation, and expand it only in use. To achieve Pop-up Print, we first conducted an experiment using selected printed sample objects with several parameters, in order to determine suitable crease patterns that make both the unfolded and folded state mechanically stable. Based on this result, we developed an interactive design tool to convert 3D models - such as a Stanford Bunny or a Huffman's cone - to the folded shape. Our design tool allows users to decide non-intuitive parameters that may affect the form's mechanical stability, while maintaining both functional crease patterns and the object's original form factor. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method through several examples of folded objects."

A tasteless gel was added, so that the sum of the currents flowing in the six gels could be kept constant, ensuring a uniform amount of stimulation on the tongue. The measured tastes could be successfully reproduced through calibration, in which the indicated taste levels were matched with the taste-sensor measurements. Furthermore, video-editing software was adapted to edit taste information as well as recorded audio and video. In addition, effector and equalizer prototypes were built that can not only reproduce the recorded tastes in their original states but also adjust the tastes to match individual preferences."

Currently, although these media may be interleaved, they remain siloed: interactive visualizations must be manually specified as they are divorced from the analysis provenance expressed via dataframes, while code cells have no access to users' interactions with visualizations, and hence no way to operate on the results of interaction. To bridge this divide, we present B2, a set of techniques grounded in treating data queries as a shared representation between the code and interactive visualizations. B2 instruments data frames to track the queries expressed in code and synthesize corresponding visualizations. These visualizations are displayed in a dashboard to facilitate interactive analysis. When an interaction occurs, B2 reifies it as a data query and generates a history log in a new code cell. Subsequent cells can use this log to further analyze interaction results and, when marked as reactive, to ensure that code is automatically recomputed when new interaction occurs. In an evaluative study with data scientists, we find that B2 promotes a tighter feedback loop between coding and interacting with visualizations. All participants frequently moved from code to visualization and vice-versa, which facilitated their exploratory data analysis in the notebook."

To explore this idea, a system is constructed to combine a head-mounted actuated pico projector with a Hololens AR headset. Projector calibration uses a modified structure from motion pipeline to reconstruct the geometric structure of the pan-tilt actuator axes and offsets. A toolkit encapsulates a set of high-level functionality to manage content placement relative to each augmented display and the physical environment.

This is because applications require users to perform numerous low-level editing operations rather than allowing them to directly indicate high-level design goals. Yet, the creation of graphic content, such as videos, animations, and presentations often begins with a description of design goals in natural language, such as screenplays, scripts, outlines. Therefore, there is an opportunity for language-oriented authoring, i.e., leveraging the information found in the structure of a language to facilitate the creation of graphic content. We present a systematic exploration of the identification, graphic description, and interaction with various linguistic structures to assist in the creation of visual content. The prototype system, Crosspower, and its proposed interaction techniques, enables content creators to indicate and customize their desired visual content in a flexible and direct manner."

Geno provides a unified workflow for developers to specify functionalities to support by voice (intents), create language models for detecting intents and the relevant information (parameters) from user utterances, and fulfill the intents by either programmatically invoking the corresponding functions or replaying GUI actions on the web app. Geno further supports references to GUI context in voice commands (e.g., \"add this to the playlist\"). In a study, developers with little NLP expertise were able to add the multi-modal support for two existing web apps using Geno."

One of the biggest challenges of HMDs is the exclusion of people in the vicinity, such as friends or family. While recent research on asymmetric interaction for VR HMDs has contributed to solving this problem in the VR domain, AR HMDs come with similar but also different problems, such as conflicting information in visualization through the HMD and projection. In this work, we propose ShARe, a modified AR HMD combined with a projector that can display augmented content onto planar surfaces to include the outside users (non-HMD users). To combat the challenge of conflicting visualization between augmented and projected content, ShARe visually aligns the content presented through the AR HMD with the projected content using an internal calibration procedure and a servo motor. Using marker tracking, non-HMD users are able to interact with the projected content using touch and gestures. To further explore the arising design space, we implemented three types of applications (collaborative game, competitive game, and external visualization). ShARe is a proof-of-concept system that showcases how AR HMDs can facilitate interaction with outside users to combat exclusion and instead foster rich, enjoyable social interactions."

Recently related work has provided algorithms for such surveys based on different prediction strategies and has identified the Root Mean Squared Error as a valuable measure to compare different strategies. However, all previously mentioned strategies have shown poor predictions in some cases. In this paper, we present a new strategy which learns from historical data. A simulation study with 10k randomly generated surveys shows its benefits and its limits.

        "abstract": "Physical buttons provide clear haptic feedback when pressed and released, but their responses are unvarying. Physical buttons can be powered by force actuators to produce unlimited click sensations, but the cost is substantial. An alternative can be augmenting physical buttons with simple and inexpensive vibration actuators. When pushed, an augmented button generates a vibration overlayed on the button's original kinesthetic response, under the general framework of haptic augmented reality. We explore the design space of augmented buttons while changing vibration frequency, amplitude, duration, and envelope. We then visualize the perceptual structure of augmented buttons by estimating a perceptual space for 7 physical buttons and 40 augmented buttons. Their sensations are also assessed against adjectives, and results are mapped into the perceptual space to identify meaningful perceptual dimensions. Our results contribute to understanding the benefits and limitations of programmable vibration-augmented physical buttons with emphasis on their feels."

So, it is straightforward to see the content from one application and write something relevant in another application, such as looking at the map around a place and typing walking instructions into an email. However, although today's smartphones also use GUIs, they have small screens and limited windowing support, making it hard to switch contexts and exchange data between apps. "

In contrast, in this work, we propose to fabricate electronics directly on the skin. We present BodyPrinter, a wearable conductive-ink deposition machine, that prints flexible electronics directly on the body using skin-safe conductive ink. The paper describes our system in detail and, through a series of examples and a technical evaluation, we show how direct on-body fabrication of electronic circuits and sensors can further enhance the human body."

With TileCode, we seek to close the gap between the consumers and creators of video games and to motivate more individuals to participate in the design and creation of their own games. The TileCode programming model is based on tile maps and provides a visual means for specifying the context around a sprite, how a sprite should move based on that context, and what should happen upon sprite collisions. We demonstrate that a variety of popular video games can be programmed with TileCode using 10-15 visual rules and compare/contrast with block-based versions of the same games implemented using MakeCode Arcade."

However, current works mainly focus on providing different force types or patterns, but do not investigate how a proper point of application of force (PAF), which means where the resultant force is applied to, affects users' experience. For example, users perceive resistive force without torque when pulling a virtual bow, but with torque when pulling a virtual slingshot. Therefore, we propose a set of handheld controllers, ElastiLinks, to provide force feedback between controllers with dynamic PAFs.A rotatable track on each controller provides a dynamic PAF, and two common types of force feedback, resistive force and impact, are produced by two links, respectively. We performed a force perception study to ascertain users' resistive and impact force level distinguishability between controllers. Based on the results, we conducted another perception study to understand users' distinguishability of PAF offset and rotation differences. Finally, we performed a VR experience study to prove that force feedback with dynamic PAFs enhances VR experience."

The promise of live programming depends on using test cases to run the program and thereby provide these runtime values. In this paper we show that in some situations test cases are insufficient in a fundamental way, in that there are no test inputs that can drive certain incomplete loops to produce useful data, a problem we call the loop-datavoid problem. The problem stems from the fact that useful data inside the loop might only be produced after the loop has been fully written. To solve this problem, we propose a paradigm called Focused Live Programming with Loop Seeds, in which the programmer provides hypothetical values to start a loop iteration, and then the programming environment focuses the live visualization on this hypothetical loop iteration. We introduce the loop-datavoid problem, present our proposed solution, explain it in detail, and then present the results of a user study."

The challenges come from the lack of accurate depth and mismatch between real and virtual depth. This paper presents GrabAR1, a new approach that directly predicts the real-and-virtual occlusion and bypasses the depth acquisition and inference. Our goal is to enhance AR applications with interactions between hand (real) and grabbable objects (virtual). With paired images of hand and object as inputs, we formulate a compact deep neural network that learns to generate the occlusion mask. To train the network, we compile a large dataset, including synthetic data and real data. We then embed the trained network in a prototyping AR system to support real-time grabbing of virtual objects. Further, we demonstrate the performance of our method on various virtual objects, compare our method with others through two user studies, and showcase a rich variety of interaction scenarios, in which we can use bare hand to grab virtual objects and directly manipulate them."

        "abstract": "Jitter in interactive systems occurs when visual feedback is perceived as unstable or trembling even though the input signal is smooth or stationary. It can have multiple causes such as sensing noise, or feedback calculations introducing or exacerbating sensing imprecisions. Jitter can however occur even when each individual component of the pipeline works perfectly, as a result of the differences between the input frequency and the display refresh rate. This asynchronicity can introduce rapidly-shifting latencies between the rendered feedbacks and their display on screen, which can result in trembling cursors or viewports. % This paper contributes a better understanding of this particular type of jitter. We first detail the problem from a mathematical standpoint, from which we develop a predictive model of jitter amplitude as a function of input and output frequencies, and a new metric to measure this spatial jitter. Using touch input data gathered in a study, we developed a simulator to validate this model and to assess the effects of different techniques and settings with any output frequency. The most promising approach, when the time of the next display refresh is known, is to estimate (interpolate or extrapolate) the user's position at a fixed time interval before that refresh. % When input events occur at 125~Hz, as is common in touch screens, we show that an interval of 4 to 6~ms works well for a wide range of display refresh rates. This method effectively cancels most of the jitter introduced by input/output asynchronicity, while introducing minimal imprecision or latency."

We propose a systematic approach for iteratively adapting the avatar to perform better for a given task based on users' performance. The approach is evaluated in a target selection task, where the forearms of the avatar are scaled to improve performance. A comparison between the optimised and real arm lengths shows a significant reduction in average tapping time by 18.7%, for forearms multiplied in length by 5.6. Additionally, with the adapted avatar, participants moved their real body and arms significantly less, and subjective measures show reduced physical demand and frustration. In a second study, we modify finger lengths for a linear tapping task to achieve a better performing avatar, which demonstrates the generalisability of the approach."

To demonstrate our technique, we created a prototype composed of a 12 x 12 grid of electrodes, made from conductive fabric attached to a textile substrate. We designed the size and separation between the electrodes to maximize the sensing area and sensitivity. We then used a 10-person study to evaluate the performance of our sensing technique using 20 different objects, which yielded a 94.5% accuracy rate.

UMSI is a deep learning-based model simultaneously trained on images from different design classes, including posters, infographics, mobile UIs, as well as natural images, and includes an automatic classification module to classify the input. This allows the model to work more effectively without requiring a user to label the input. We also introduce Imp1k, a new dataset of designs annotated with importance information.

Communication between them is difficult; the VR user cannot see the external user's gestures, and the external user cannot see VR scene elements outside of the VR user's view. We carried out formative interviews with experts to understand these asymmetrical interactions and identify their goals and challenges. From this, we identify high-level system design goals to facilitate asymmetrical interactions and a corresponding space of implementation approaches based on the level of programmatic access to a VR application. We present TransceiVR, a system that utilizes VR platform APIs to enable asymmetric communication interfaces for third-party applications without requiring source code access. TransceiVR allows external users to explore the VR scene spatially or temporally, to annotate elements in the VR scene at correct depths, and to discuss via a shared static virtual display. An initial co-located user evaluation with 10 pairs shows that our system makes asymmetric collaborations in VR more effective and successful in terms of task time, error rate, and task load index. An informal evaluation with a remote expert gives additional insight on utility of features for real world tasks."

        "abstract": "Immersive authoring is a paradigm that makes Virtual Reality (VR) application development easier by allowing programmers to create VR content while immersed in the virtual environment. In this paradigm, programmers manipulate programming primitives through direct manipulation and get immediate feedback on their program's state and output. However, existing immersive authoring tools have a low ceiling; their programming primitives are intuitive but can only express a limited set of static relationships between elements in a scene. In this paper, we introduce FlowMatic, an immersive authoring tool that raises the ceiling of expressiveness by allowing programmers to specify reactive behaviors---behaviors that react to discrete events such as user actions, system timers, or collisions. FlowMatic also introduces primitives for programmatically creating and destroying new objects, for abstracting and re-using functionality, and for importing 3D models. Importantly, FlowMatic uses novel visual representations to allow these primitives to be represented directly in VR. We also describe the results of a user study that illustrates the usability advantages of FlowMatic relative to a 2D authoring tool and we demonstrate its expressiveness through several example applications that would be impossible to implement with existing immersive authoring tools. By combining a visual program representation with expressive programming primitives and a natural User Interface (UI) for authoring programs, FlowMatic shows how programmers can build fully interactive virtual experiences with immersive authoring."

        "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are increasingly used to perform simple operations such as a moving a cursor, but have remained of limited use for more complex tasks. In our new approach to BCI, we use brain relevance feedback to control a generative adversarial network (GAN). We obtained EEG data from 31 participants who viewed face images while concentrating on particular facial features. Following, an EEG relevance classifier was trained and propagated as feedback on the latent image representation provided by the GAN. Estimates for individual vectors matching the relevant criteria were iteratively updated to optimize an image generation process towards mental targets. A double-blind evaluation showed high performance (86.26% accuracy) against random feedback (18.71%), and not significantly lower than explicit feedback (93.30%). Furthermore, we show the feasibility of the method with simultaneous task targets demonstrating BCI operation beyond individual task constraints. Thus, brain relevance feedback can validly control a generative model, overcoming a critical limitation of current BCI approaches."

        "abstract": "Augmenting human action videos with visual effects often requires professional tools and skills. To make this more accessible by novice users, existing attempts have focused on automatically adding visual effects to faces and hands, or let virtual objects strictly track certain body parts, resulting in rigid-looking effects. We present PoseTween, an interactive system that allows novice users to easily add vivid virtual objects with their movement interacting with a moving subject in an input video. Our key idea is to leverage the motion of the subject to create pose-driven tween animations of virtual objects. With our tool, a user only needs to edit the properties of a virtual object with respect to the subject's movement at keyframes, and the object is associated with certain body parts automatically. The properties of the object at intermediate frames are then determined by both the body movement and the interpolated object keyframe properties, producing natural object movements and interactions with the subject. We design a user interface to facilitate editing of keyframes and previewing animation results. Our user study shows that PoseTween significantly requires less editing time and fewer keyframes than using the traditional tween animation in making pose-driven tween animations for novice users."

Prior studies have shown that current repair strategies for these kinds of errors are often ineffective due to: (1) the lack of transparency about the state of the system's understanding of the user's utterance; and (2) the system's limited capabilities to understand the user's verbal attempts to repair natural language understanding errors. This paper introduces SOVITE, a new multi-modal speech plus direct manipulation interface that helps users discover, identify the causes of, and recover from conversational breakdowns using the resources of existing mobile app GUIs for grounding. SOVITE displays the system's understanding of user intents using GUI screenshots, allows users to refer to third-party apps and their GUI screens in conversations as inputs for intent disambiguation, and enables users to repair breakdowns using direct manipulation on these screenshots. The results from a remote user study with 10 users using SOVITE in 7 scenarios suggested that SOVITE's approach is usable and effective."

In this work, we introduce new opportunities for the Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA), which is ubiquitous in such devices due to its capability for providing rich haptic feedback. By leveraging strategies to enable active and passive sensing capabilities with LRAs, we demonstrate their benefits and potential as self-contained I/O devices. Specifically, we use the back-EMF voltage to classify if the LRA is tapped, touched, as well as how much pressure is being applied. The back-EMF sensing is already integrated into many motor and LRA drivers. We developed a passive low-power tap sensing method that uses just 37.7 uA. Furthermore, we developed active touch and pressure sensing, which is low-power, quiet (2 dB), and minimizes vibration. The sensing method works with many types of LRAs. We show applications, such as pressure-sensing side-buttons on a mobile phone. We have also implemented our technique directly on an existing mobile phone's LRA to detect if the phone is handheld or placed on a soft or hard surface. Finally, we show that this method can be used for haptic devices to determine if the LRA makes good contact with the skin. Our approach can add rich sensing capabilities to the ubiquitous LRA actuators without requiring additional sensors or hardware."

DeepFisheye acquires the image of an interacting hand positioned above the touchscreen using the camera and employs deep learning to estimate the 3D position of each fingertip. We created two new hand pose datasets comprising fisheye images, on which our network was trained. We evaluated DeepFisheye's performance for three device sizes. DeepFisheye showed average errors with approximate value of 20 mm for fingertip tracking across the different device sizes. Additionally, we created simple rule-based classifiers that estimate the contact finger and hand posture from DeepFisheye's output. The contact finger and hand posture classifiers showed accuracy of approximately 83 and 90%, respectively, across the device sizes."

        "abstract": "We propose a novel text decoding method that enables touch typing on an uninstrumented flat surface. Rather than relying on physical keyboards or capacitive touch, our method takes as input hand motion of the typist, obtained through hand-tracking, and decodes this motion directly into text. We use a temporal convolutional network to represent a motion model that maps the hand motion, represented as a sequence of hand pose features, into text characters. To enable touch typing without the haptic feedback of a physical keyboard, we had to address more erratic typing motion due to drift of the fingers. Thus, we incorporate a language model as a text prior and use beam search to efficiently combine our motion and language models to decode text from erratic or ambiguous hand motion. We collected a dataset of 20 touch typists and evaluated our model on several baselines, including contact-based text decoding and typing on a physical keyboard. Our proposed method is able to leverage continuous hand pose information to decode text more accurately than contact-based methods and an offline study shows parity (73 WPM, 2.38% UER) with typing on a physical keyboard. Our results show that hand-tracking has the potential to enable rapid text entry in mobile environments."

Inspired by assembly planning, we analyze the input video using a 3D CAD model of the object to determine an assembly graph that encodes blocking relationships between parts. Using an assembly graph enables us to detect assembly steps that are otherwise difficult to extract from the video, and generally improves object detection and tracking by providing prior knowledge about movable parts. To avoid information loss, we combine the 3D animation with relevant parts of the 2D video so that we can show detailed manipulations and tool usage that cannot be easily extracted from the video. To further support user orientation, we visually align the 3D animation with the real-world object by using texture information from the input video. We developed a presentation system that uses commonly available hardware to make our results accessible for home use and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it to traditional video tutorials."

We customize an AR head-mounted device with multiple camera systems that allow for non-intrusive capturing of user's daily activities.

With our visual programming interface, users create human-centered rules for the applications and experience them instantly in AR. We further demonstrate four use cases enabled by CAPturAR. Also, we verify the effectiveness of the AR-HMD and the authoring workflow with a system evaluation using our prototype. Moreover, we conduct a remote user study in an AR simulator to evaluate the usability."

We ran three Mechanical Turk studies to evaluate user preferences for various text- and visualization widget-based autocompletion design variants for helping with partial search queries. Our findings indicate that users found data previews to be useful in the suggestions. Widgets were preferred for previewing temporal, geospatial, and numerical data while text autocompletion was preferred for categorical and hierarchical data. We conducted an exploratory analysis of our system implementing this specific subset of preferred autocompletion variants. Our insights regarding the efficacy of these autocompletion suggestions can inform the future design of natural language interfaces supporting visual analysis."

This paper presents HapLinkage, a prototyping framework based on linkage mechanism, that provides typical motion templates and haptic renderers to facilitate proxy design of virtual hand tools. The mechanical structures can be easily modified, for example, to scale the size, or to change the range of motion by selectively changing linkage lengths. Resistant, stop, release, and restoration force feedback are generated by an actuating module as part of the structure. Additional vibration feedback can be generated with a linear actuator. HapLinkage enables easy and quick prototypting of hand tools for diverse VR scenarios, that embody both of their kinetic and haptic properties. Based on interviews with expert designers, it was confirmed that HapLinkage is expressive in designing haptic proxy of hand tools to enhance VR experiences. It also identified potentials and future development of the framework."

We implement adaptive video playback in Reactive Video, a vision-based system which supports users learning or practising a physical skill. The use of pre-existing videos removes the need to create bespoke content or specially authored videos, and the system can provide real-time guidance and feedback to better support users when learning new movements. Adaptive video playback using a discrete Bayes and particle filter are evaluated on a data set collected of participants performing tai chi and radio exercises. Results show that both approaches can accurately adapt to the user's movements, however reversing playback can be problematic."

Voice input is a natural candidate for interacting with out-of-reach and often small devices that lack full-sized physical interfaces. However, at present, voice agents generally require wake-words and device names in order to specify the target of a spoken command (e.g., 'Hey Alexa, kitchen lights to full bright-ness'). In this research, we explore whether speech alone can be used as a directional communication channel, in much the same way visual gaze specifies a focus. Instead of a device's microphones simply receiving and processing spoken commands, we suggest they also infer the Direction of Voice (DoV). Our approach innately enables voice commands with addressability (i.e., devices know if a command was directed at them) in a natural and rapid manner. We quantify the accuracy of our implementation across users, rooms, spoken phrases, and other key factors that affect performance and usability. Taken together, we believe our DoV approach demonstrates feasibility and the promise of making distributed voice interactions much more intuitive and fluid."

        "abstract": "We present Omni, a self-contained 3D haptic feedback system that is capable of sensing and actuating an untethered, passive tool containing only a small embedded permanent magnet. Omni enriches AR, VR and desktop applications by providing an active haptic experience using a simple apparatus centered around an electromagnetic base. The spatial haptic capabilities of Omni are enabled by a novel gradient-based method to reconstruct the 3D position of the permanent magnet in midair using the measurements from eight off-the-shelf hall sensors that are integrated into the base. Omni's 3 DoF spherical electromagnet simultaneously exerts dynamic and precise radial and tangential forces in a volumetric space around the device. Since our system is fully integrated, contains no moving parts and requires no external tracking, it is easy and affordable to fabricate. We describe Omni's hardware implementation, our 3D reconstruction algorithm, and evaluate the tracking and actuation performance in depth. Finally, we demonstrate its capabilities via a set of interactive usage scenarios."

        "abstract": "We introduce an optimal control method for electromagnetic haptic guidance systems. Our real-time approach assists users in pen-based tasks such as drawing, sketching or designing. The key to our control method is that it guides users, yet does not take away agency. Existing approaches force the stylus to a continuously advancing setpoint on a target trajectory, leading to undesirable behavior such as loss of haptic guidance or unintended snapping. Our control approach, in contrast, gently pulls users towards the target trajectory, allowing them to always easily override the system to adapt their input spontaneously and draw at their own speed. To achieve this flexible guidance, our optimization iteratively predicts the motion of an input device such as a pen, and adjusts the position and strength of an underlying dynamic electromagnetic actuator accordingly. To enable real-time computation, we additionally introduce a novel and fast approximate model of an electromagnet. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by implementing it on a prototypical hardware platform based on an electromagnet moving on a bi-axial linear stage, as well as a set of applications. Experimental results show that our approach is more accurate and preferred by users compared to open-loop and time-dependent closed-loop approaches."
