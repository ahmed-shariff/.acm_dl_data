The interface consists of several photoreflectors that consist of an IR LED and a phototransistor and elastic fabric such as stocking and rubber membrane. The sensing method used is based on our observation that photoreflectors can be used to measure the ratio of expansion and contraction of a stocking using the changes in transmissivity of IR light passing through the stocking. Since a stocking is thin, stretchable, and nearly transparent, it can be easily attached to various types of objects such as mobile devices, robots, and different parts of the body as well as to various types of conventional pressure sensors without altering the original shape of the object. It can also present natural haptic feedback in accordance with the amount of force exerted. A system using several such sensors can determine the direction of a two-dimensional force. A variety of example applications illustrated the utility of this sensing system."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 25th annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}12", "title": "Acoustic barcodes", "author": "Chris Harrison and Robert Xiao and Scott Hudson", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F2380116.2380187", "doi": "10.1145/2380116.2380187", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Harrison_2012", "abstract": "We present acoustic barcodes, structured patterns of physical notches that, when swiped with e.g., a fingernail, produce a complex sound that can be resolved to a binary ID.

We introduce Midas, a software and hardware toolkit to support the design, fabrication, and programming of flexible capacitive touch sensors for interactive objects. With Midas, designers first define the desired shape, layout, and type of touch sensitive areas, as well as routing obstacles, in a sensor editor. From this high-level specification, Midas automatically generates layout files with appropriate sensor pads and routed connections. These files are then used to fabricate sensors using digital fabrication processes, e.g., vinyl cutters and conductive ink printers. Using step-by-step assembly instructions generated by Midas, designers connect these sensors to the Midas microcontroller, which detects touch events. Once the prototype is assembled, designers can define interactivity for their sensors: Midas supports both record-and-replay actions for controlling existing local applications and WebSocket-based event output for controlling novel or remote applications. In a first-use study with three participants, users successfully prototyped media players.

The projected image serves a dual purpose by simultaneously presenting a visible interface to the user, and transmitting embedded control information to inexpensive sensor units integrated with the devices. To use PICOntrol, the user points the handheld projector at a target device, overlays a projected user interface on its sensor unit, and performs various GUI-style or gestural interactions. PICOntrol enables direct, visible, and rich interactions with various physical devices without requiring central infrastructure.

However, existing transfer functions are typically \"black boxes\" bundled into proprietary operating systems and drivers. This presents three problems for researchers: (1) a lack of knowledge about the current state of the field; (2) a difficulty in replicating research that uses scrolling devices; and (3) a potential experimental confound when evaluating scrolling devices and techniques. These three problems are caused by gaps in researchers' knowledge about what device and movement factors are important for scrolling transfer functions, and about how existing devices and drivers use these factors. We fill these knowledge gaps with a framework of transfer function factors for scrolling, and a method for analysing proprietary transfer functions---demonstrating how state of the art commercial devices accommodate some of the human control phenomena observed in prior studies."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 25th annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}12", "title": "Giving a hand to the eyes", "author": "Nicolas Roussel and G{\\'{e}}ry Casiez and Jonathan Aceituno and Daniel Vogel", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F2380116.2380162", "doi": "10.1145/2380116.2380162", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Roussel_2012", "abstract": "We argue that the current practice of using integer positions for pointing events artificially constrains human precision capabilities.

Prior work has developed several techniques to ease query specification but none of these techniques are applicable to a particularly difficult class of queries: quantified queries.

We identify two impediments to this form of interactive trial-and-error query specification in SQL: (i) changing quantifiers often requires global syntactical query restructuring, and (ii) the absence of non-answers from SQL's results makes verifying query correctness difficult. We remedy these issues with DataPlay, a query tool with an underlying graphical query language, a unique data model and a graphical interface. DataPlay provides two interaction features that support trial-and-error query specification. First, DataPlay allows users to directly manipulate a graphical query by changing quantifiers and modifying dependencies between constraints. Users receive real-time feedback in the form of updated answers and non-answers. Second, DataPlay can auto-correct a user's query, based on user feedback about which tuples to keep or drop from the answers and non-answers. We evaluated the effectiveness of each interaction feature with a user study and we found that direct query manipulation is more effective than auto-correction for simple queries but auto-correction is more effective than direct query manipulation for more complex queries."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 25th annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}12", "title": "{ConstraintJS}", "author": "Stephen Oney and Brad Myers and Joel Brandt", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F2380116.2380146", "doi": "10.1145/2380116.2380146", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Oney_2012", "abstract": "Interactive behaviors in GUIs are often described in terms of states, transitions, and constraints, where the constraints only hold in certain states.

SnipMatch leverages this information, in conjunction with current code context, to improve snippet search and parameterization.

Instead of an abstract visual criterion, players in this game learn models to optimize interaction (the game's duration). This two-way sketching game addresses problems essential in emerging interfaces (such as learning and how to deal with interpretation errors).

The system targets mobile settings, and is specifically designed to be low-power and easily reproducible using only off-the-shelf hardware. The electronics are self-contained on the user's wrist, but optically image the entirety of the user's hand. This data is processed using a new pipeline that robustly samples key parts of the hand, such as the tips and lower regions of each finger. These sparse samples are fed into new kinematic models that leverage the biomechanical constraints of the hand to recover the 3D pose of the user's hand. The proposed system works without the need for full instrumentation of the hand (for example using data gloves), additional sensors in the environment, or depth cameras which are currently prohibitive for mobile scenarios due to power and form-factor considerations. We demonstrate the utility of Digits for a variety of application scenarios, including 3D spatial interaction with mobile devices, eyes-free interaction on-the-move, and gaming. We conclude with a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our system, and discussion of strengths, limitations and future work."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 25th annual {ACM} symposium on User interface software and technology - {UIST} {\\textquotesingle}12", "title": "{YourGloves}, hothands and hotmits", "author": "Daniel Gooch and Leon Watts", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2012", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F2380116.2380138", "doi": "10.1145/2380116.2380138", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Gooch_2012", "abstract": "There is a growing body of work in HCI on the design of communication technologies to help support lovers in long distance relationships.

To address the complexity of recognizing bimanual gesture, we designed and implemented two related interaction methods, finger-release and space-required, both based on a new multi-stroke gesture recognition algorithm.
