'Empty moments' provide a compelling new opportunity for design, requiring subtlety and flexibility to enable participants to share connection without explicit messages. We designed MissU as a technology probe to study empty moments in situ. Similar to a private radio station, MissU shares music and background sounds.

With the same amount of practice, users could successfully recall more shortcuts and make fewer errors with stroke shortcuts than with keyboard shortcuts. The second half of the paper focuses on UI development support and articulates guidelines for toolkits to implement stroke shortcuts in a wide range of software applications.

These themes provide a set of sensitivities or orientations that may complement traditional task-based approaches to evaluation as well as the more open-ended ones we describe here. Our system showed symptoms of failure under each of these themes. We examine the reasons for this at three levels: problems particular to the specific design hypothesis; problems relevant for input-output mapping more generally; and problems in the design process we used.

Conflicts may also arise because indirect techniques reduce territorial behavior, expanding the interaction space of each collaborator. In this paper, we introduce three new tabletop coordination techniques designed to reduce conflicts arising from indirect input, while still allowing users the flexibility of distant object control. Two techniques were designed to promote territoriality and to allow users to protect objects when they work near their personal areas, and the third technique lets users set their protection levels dynamically.

As such, intelligence does not just belong to the province of the human mind, but can emerge in quite different, unexpected forms in things.

In this paper we describe a series of experiments designed to evaluate the effects of semantic versus alphabetical and random arrangements of tags in tag clouds. The results of our work indicate that semantically clustered tag clouds can provide improvements over random layouts in specific search tasks and that they tend to increase the attention towards tags in small fonts compared to other layouts. Also, semantically structured tag clouds were preferred by about half of the users for general search tasks.

We examine our proposed synergy in the context of Wikipedia infoboxes and the Kylin information extraction system. After developing and refining a set of interfaces to present the verification of Kylin extractions as a non primary task in the context of Wikipedia articles, we develop an innovative use of Web search advertising services to study people engaged in some other primary task. We demonstrate our proposed synergy by analyzing our deployment from two complementary perspectives: (1) we show we accelerate community content creation by using Kylin's information extraction to significantly increase the likelihood that a person visiting a Wikipedia article as a part of some other primary task will spontaneously choose to help improve the article's infobox, and (2) we show we accelerate information extraction by using contributions collected from people interacting with our designs to significantly improve Kylin's extraction performance."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "{PlayByPlay}", "author": "Heather Wiltse and Jeffrey Nichols", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1518701.1518975", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518975", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Wiltse_2009", "abstract": "Collaborative web browsing tasks occur frequently, such as one user showing another how to use a web site, several users working together on a search task, or even one user sending an interesting link to another user.

Results show that participants adapted their task interleaving strategies to meet the required task objective, but in a manner that was nonetheless intricately shaped by internal psychological constraints. In particular, participants tended to steer in between dialing chunks of digits even when extreme vehicle drift implied that more reactive strategies would have generated better lane keeping. To better understand why drivers interleaved tasks at chunk boundaries, a modeling analysis was conducted to derive performance predictions for a range of dialing strategies. The analysis supported the idea that interleaving at chunk boundaries efficiently traded the time given up to dialing with the maintenance of a central lane position.

We found that programmers leverage online resources with a range of intentions: They engage in just-in-time learning of new skills and approaches, clarify and extend their existing knowledge, and remind themselves of details deemed not worth remembering. The results also suggest that queries for different purposes have different styles and durations. Do programmers' queries \"in the wild\" have the same range of intentions, or is this result an artifact of the particular lab setting? We analyzed a month of queries to an online programming portal, examining the lexical structure, refinements made, and result pages visited.

However, unlike many other examples of collective intelligence, tasks in Wikipedia can be deeply interdependent and may incur high coordination costs among editors. Increasing the number of editors increases the resources available to the system, but it also raises the costs of coordination. This suggests that the dependencies of tasks in Wikipedia may determine whether they benefit from increasing the number of editors involved. Specifically, we hypothesize that adding editors may benefit low-coordination tasks but have negative consequences for tasks requiring a high degree of coordination. Furthermore, concentrating the work to reduce coordination dependencies should enable more efficient work by many editors. Analyses of both article ratings and article review comments provide support for both hypotheses. These results suggest ways to better harness the efforts of many editors in social collaborative systems involving high coordination tasks."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Coordinating tasks on the commons", "author": "Michel Krieger and Emily Margarete Stark and Scott R.

Our method, called the Angle Mouse, adjusts the mouse C-D gain based on the deviation of angles sampled during movement. When angular deviation is low, the gain is kept high. When angular deviation is high, the gain is dropped, making the target bigger in motor-space. A key feature of the Angle Mouse is that, unlike most pointing facilitation techniques, it is target-agnostic, requiring no knowledge of target locations or dimensions. This means that the problem of distractor targets is avoided because adaptation is based solely on the user's behavior. In a study of 16 people, 8 of which had motor impairments, we found that the Angle Mouse improved motor-impaired pointing throughput by 10.3% over the Windows default mouse and 11.0% over sticky icons. For able-bodied users, there was no significant difference among the three techniques, as Angle Mouse throughput was within 1.2% of the default. Thus, the Angle Mouse improved pointing performance for users with motor impairments while remaining unobtrusive for able-bodied users."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Resonance on the web", "author": "Eytan Adar and Jaime Teevan and Susan T.

We explain why this new mechanism is superior for input data with certain characteristics, introduce an enjoyable new game called \"TagATune\" that collects tags for music clips via this mechanism, and present findings on the data that is collected by this game."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Capturing and sharing memories in a virtual world", "author": "Carman Neustaedter and Elena Fedorovskaya", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1518701.1518878", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518878", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Neustaedter_2009", "abstract": "Virtual worlds (VWs) such as Second Life\u00ae (SL) contain a rich social culture where people engage in a multitude of experiences much like real life.

Our results identify two clusters of users - Casuals and Lifers - who differed in the ways in which they captured and shared memories.

This is achieved by offering a complete tool chain with one, consistent programming paradigm. Each link is a separate tool offering a tailored amount of flexibility and complexity. To ensure that users can understand the feedback the SDK provides them, it is given in terms of the tool currently used. Furthermore, by preventing runtime errors, a user can be sure a program will work correctly if it compiles.

They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Passive photography from a creative perspective", "author": "Sara Ljungblad", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1518701.1518828", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518828", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Ljungblad_2009", "abstract": "This paper aims to contribute with an understanding of meaningful experiences of photography, to support reflection upon the design of future camera devices.

Once the motion has been recognized by the system, the user can confirm the selection to trigger the action. We consider cyclic motions on an elliptic trajectory with a specific period, and study the most effective methods for real-time matching such a trajectory, as well as the range of parameters a human can reliably reproduce.

Our experiences with EyeSpy support reflection upon the design challenges presented by 'human computation' and the production of usable by-products through mobile game-play."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Getting inspired!", "author": "Scarlett R.

This is problematic for both the understanding of design activity as well as for developing more effective design tools. In this paper, we report results of a study that understands and compares how designers (N=11) utilize, manage, and share examples to support the creative design process. The domains studied were Web, graphic, and product design. Our study shows that examples are a cornerstone of creative practice and are utilized for many reasons throughout the design process. Since examples are pivotal to the success of a project, more effective tools that support retrieval, storage, and dissemination of examples are needed. This paper contributes understanding of the benefits and roles of examples in the design process and implications for the design of more effective tools that support example usage."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Using improvisation to enhance the effectiveness of brainstorming", "author": "Elizabeth Gerber", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1518701.1518718", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518718", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Gerber_2009", "abstract": "Group brainstorming is a popular ideation method for design teams, yet brainstorming outcomes vary greatly. The method depends on individuals working collectively to generate ideas, and so group dynamics determine whether the method succeeds or fails. This paper explores how interaction designers used techniques from theatrical improvisation, or improv, to adhere to the rules of brainstorming thereby enhancing group interactions while collaborating. The usefulness of improvisation for brainstorming stems from the similarity of the goals of improvisation and brainstorming, the similarity of the recurrent problems that actors and designers encounter when collaborating, and the distinctness of the ways each have devised to resolve the problems that block the group's performance. This paper reflects on the individual- and group-level outcomes for design students and practitioners while brainstorming."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Team analytics", "author": "Jan H.

Using signaling theory as a conceptual framework, we describe how certain 'signals' in various social software are hard to fake, and are thus more reliable indicators of expertise. Multi-level regression analysis revealed that participation in social software, social connection information, and self-described expertise in the corporate directory were significantly helpful in the decision to contact someone for expertise. Qualitative analysis provided further insights regarding the interpretations people form of others' expertise from digital artifacts. We conclude with suggestions on differentiating various types of information available within online profiles and implications for the design of expertise locator/recommender systems."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - {CHI} 09", "title": "Expert recommender systems in practice", "author": "Tim Reichling and Volker Wulf", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2009", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1518701.1518712", "doi": "10.1145/1518701.1518712", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Reichling_2009", "abstract": "Expert recommender systems (ERS) are considered a promising technology in knowledge management.

Web pages were iteratively decomposed into quadrants of minimum entropy (quadtree decomposition) based on low-level image statistics, to permit a characterization of these pages in terms of their respective organizational symmetry, balance and equilibrium. These attributes were then evaluated for their correlation with human participants' subjective ratings of the same web pages on four aesthetic and affective dimensions. Several of these correlations were quite large and revealed interesting patterns in the relationship between low-level (i.e., pixel-level) image statistics and design-relevant dimensions."}]
