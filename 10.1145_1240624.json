However, when the design's objective is to train users to interact with interfaces that are highly dependent on spatial properties (e.g. keypad layout or gesture shapes) we contend that designers should consider explicitly increasing the mental effort of interaction. To test the hypothesis that effort aids spatial memory, we designed a \"frost-brushing\" interface that forces the user to mentally retrieve spatial information, or to physically brush away the frost to obtain visual guidance. We report results from two experiments using virtual keypad interfaces -- the first concerns spatial location learning of buttons on the keypad, and the second concerns both location and trajectory learning of gesture shape. The results support our hypothesis, showing that the frost-brushing design improved spatial learning. The participants' subjective responses emphasised the connections between effort, engagement, boredom, frustration, and enjoyment, suggesting that effort requires careful parameterisation to maximise its effectiveness."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "Multiple mice for retention tasks in disadvantaged schools", "author": "Udai Singh Pawar and Joyojeet Pal and Rahul Gupta and Kentaro Toyama", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240864", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240864", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Pawar_2007", "abstract": "This study evaluates single-mouse and multiple-mice configurations for computer-aided learning in schools where access to computers is limited due to resource constraints. Multimouse, a single display groupware solution, developed to allow multiple mice to be used simultaneously on a single PC, is compared with single-user-single-mouse and multiple-user-single-mouse scenarios. Multimouse itself is trialed with two unique interaction designs -- one where competitive interaction among students is encouraged, and another where more collaborative interaction is expected. Experiments were conducted with 238 schoolchildren from underprivileged households in rural India on an English vocabulary retention task. On the whole, Multimouse configurations (five users each) were found to be at par with single-user scenarios in terms of actual words learned by students. This suggests that the value of a PC can be inexpensively multiplied by employing a multi-input shared-use design. Gender effects were found, where boys show significant differences in learning depending on interaction modality, whereas girls learned at similar rates across configurations. In addition, a comparison of the two Multimouse modes -- collaborative and competitive -- showed the striking difference in learning outcomes and user behavior that is possible due to even slight variations in interaction designs for multiple-mice."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "Social responses to virtual humans", "author": "Catherine Amine Zanbaka and Amy Catherine Ulinski and Paula Goolkasian and Larry F.

Participants were randomly assigned to perform both simple and complex tasks alone and in the presence of either a real human, a projected virtual human, or a virtual human in a head-mounted display. Our results showed participants were inhibited by the presence of others, whether real or virtual. That is, participants performed worse on the complex task, both in terms of percent correct and reaction times, when in the presence of others than when alone.

The occlusion technique evaluates IVIS tasks in interrupted vision conditions, aiming to predict likely visual demand. However, the technique necessitates performance-focused user trials utilising robust prototypes, and consequently has limitations as an economic evaluation method. HCI practitioners view the Keystroke Level Model (KLM) as a reliable and valid means of modelling human performance, not requiring empirical trials or working prototypes. This paper proposes an extended KLM, which aims to predict measures based on the occlusion protocol. To validate the new method, we compared results of an occlusion study with predictions based on the assumptions of the extended KLM. Analysis revealed significant correlations between observed and predicted results (R=0.93-0.98) and low error rates (7-13%). In conclusion, the extended KLM shows considerable merit as a first-pass design tool."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "Similarity is more important than expertise", "author": "Nils Dahlb\u00c3\u00a4ck and QianYing Wang and Clifford Nass and Jenny Alwin", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240859", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240859", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Dahlb_ck_2007", "abstract": "In a balanced between-participants experiment (N = 96) American and Swedish participants listened to tourist information on a website about an American or Swedish city presented in English with either an American or Swedish accent and evaluated the speakers' knowledge of the topic, the voice characteristics, and the information characteristics.

This is due, in part, to the communicative efficiencies provided by the shared visual context. However, a large gap exists between our current theoretical understanding and our existing models. We address this gap by developing a computational model that integrates linguistic cues with visual cues in a way that effectively models reference during tightly-coupled, task-oriented interactions. The results demonstrate that an integrated model significantly outperforms existing language-only and visual-only models. The findings can be used to inform and augment the development of conversational agents, applications that dynamically track discourse and collaborative interactions, and dialogue managers for natural language interfaces."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "An interface to support color blind computer users", "author": "Luke Jefferson and Richard Harvey", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240855", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240855", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Jefferson_2007", "abstract": "A new method for adapting digital images so that they are suitable for color blind viewers is presented.

The three remote methods are a remote synchronous condition, where testing is conducted in real time but the test monitor is separated spatially from the test subjects, and two remote asynchronous conditions, where the test monitor and the test subjects are separated both spatially and temporally. The results show that the remote synchronous method is virtually equivalent to the conventional method. Thereby, it has the potential to conveniently involve broader user groups in usability testing and support new development approaches.

It provides immediate awareness of potential conflict situations, such as two programmers editing the same source file. FASTDash was developed through user-centered design, including surveys, team interviews, and in situ observation. Results from a field study show that FASTDash improved team awareness, reduced reliance on shared artifacts, and increased project-related communication.

Through the fieldwork we demonstrate ways in which collecting and keeping have important social values over and above simply consuming the content in situ.

Further, we see how narratives told around the collected location-based content over time imbue it with additional value.

A user study shows that the visual programming metaphor enables prototypes to be built faster and encourages more iterations than a previous approach."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "How {HCI} interprets the probes", "author": "Kirsten Boehner and Janet Vertesi and Phoebe Sengers and Paul Dourish", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240789", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240789", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Boehner_2007", "abstract": "We trace how cultural probes have been adopted and adapted by the HCI community.

The positions of these physical objects represent and control parameters inside a software application, such as a system for optimizing the configuration of radio towers in a cellular telephone network. The computer autonomously attempts to optimize the network, moving the objects on the table as it changes their corresponding parameters in software. As these objects move, the user can constrain their motion with his or her hands, or many other kinds of physical objects. The interface provides ample opportunities for improvisation by allowing the user to employ a rich variety of everyday physical objects as mechanical constraints. This approach leverages the user's mechanical intuition for how objects respond to physical forces. As well, it allows the user to balance the numerical optimization performed by the computer with other goals that are difficult to quantify.

You can freely choose the form of physical exercise, which makes it easier for people with different skill levels and backgrounds to play together. The system can be used with any exercise machine or form. To make playing meaningful instead of simply exercising as hard as you can, a high heart rate impedes the shooting part of the game by making the sight less steady.

WCD addresses a long-standing need for more effective methods of function allocation. The illustrating case study succeeded on a large, difficult problem for aircraft scheduling where prior expensive attempts failed. The new system, called Solver, reduces scheduling labor from 9 person-days a week to about 1 person-hour. These results were obtained from the first user test, demonstrating notable effectiveness of WCD. Further, the value of Solver's higher quality schedules is far-reaching.

We argue that the main reasons are the occlusion of the target by the user's finger and ambiguity about which part of the finger defines the selection point. We propose a pointing technique we call Shift that is designed to address these issues. When the user touches the screen, Shift creates a callout showing a copy of the occluded screen area and places it in a non-occluded location. The callout also shows a pointer representing the selection point of the finger. Using this visual feedback, users guide the pointer into the target by moving their finger on the screen surface and commit the target acquisition by lifting the finger. Unlike existing techniques, Shift is only invoked when necessary--over large targets no callout is created and users enjoy the full performance of an unaltered touch screen. We report the results of a user study showing that with Shift participants can select small targets with much lower error rates than an unaided touch screen and that Shift is faster than Offset Cursor for larger targets."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "An alternative to push, press, and tap-tap-tap", "author": "Jacob O.

The large decrease in performance for informational search is probably because users have high confidence in the search engine's ranking; in contrast to navigational tasks, where the target is more obvious from information presented in the results, in informational tasks, users try out the top ranked results even if these results are perceived as less relevant for the task."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "A minimal model for predicting visual search in human-computer interaction", "author": "Tim Halverson and Anthony J.

In contrast to previous efforts that are based on simulation of a cognitive architecture interacting with a task environment, we take an approach that develops a cognitive constraint model of the interaction between the driver and the task environment in order to make inferences about dual-task performance. Analyses of driving performance data reveal that a set of simple equations can be used to accurately model changes in the lateral position of the vehicle within the lane. The model quantifies how the vehicle's deviation from lane center increases during periods of inattention, and how the vehicle returns to lane center during periods of active steering. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach by modeling the dialing of a cellular phone while driving, where drivers balance the speed in performing the dial task with accuracy (or safety) in keeping the vehicle centered in the roadway. In particular, we show how understanding, rather than simulating, the constraints imposed by the task environment can help to explain the costs and benefits of a range of strategies for interleaving dialing and steering. We show how particular strategies are sensitive to a combination of internal constraints (including switch costs) and the trade-off between the amount of time allocated to secondary task and the risk of extreme lane deviation."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "A game design methodology to incorporate social activist themes", "author": "Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240654", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240654", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Flanagan_2007", "abstract": "Can a set of articulated and tested methodologies be created whose endpoint is the reliable capacity for taking activist social themes into account?

We find evidence that SenseCam images do facilitate people's ability to connect to their past, but that images do this in different ways. We make a distinction between \"remembering\" the past, and \"knowing\" about it, and provide evidence that SenseCam images work differently over time in these capacities. We also compare the efficacy of user-captured images with automatically captured images and discuss the implications of these findings and others for how we conceive of and make claims about life-logging technologies."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "Understanding videowork", "author": "David Kirk and Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper and Ken Wood", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240634", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240634", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Kirk_2007", "abstract": "In this paper we elucidate the patterns of behavior of home movie makers through a study of 12 families and a separate focus group of 7 teenagers.

From our analysis, we derive a videowork lifecycle to frame the practices users engage in when working with video technologies in the home, and uncover two broad types of video usage therein.

The guideline advocates matching the amount of attention attracted by an interruption's notification method (attentional draw) to the utility of the interruption content. Our first experiment examined a set of 10 visual notification signals in terms of their detection times and established a set of three significantly different signals along the spectrum of attentional draw. Our second experiment investigated matching these different signals to interruption content with different levels of utility. Results indicate that the matching strategy decreases annoyance and increases perception of benefit compared to a strategy that uses the same signal regardless of interruption utility, with no significant impact on workload or performance. Design implications arising from the second experiment as well as recommendations for future work are discussed."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "How it works", "author": "Joe Tullio and Anind K.

We present an investigation into how users come to understand an intelligent system as they use it in their daily work. During a six-week field study, we interviewed eight office workers regarding the operation of a system that predicted their managers' interruptibility, comparing their mental models to the actual system model. Our results show that by the end of the study, participants were able to discount some of their initial misconceptions about what information the system used for reasoning about interruptibility. However, the overarching structures of their mental models stayed relatively stable over the course of the study. Lastly, we found that participants were able to give lay descriptions attributing simple machine learning concepts to the system despite their lack of technical knowledge. Our findings suggest an appropriate level of feedback for user interfaces of intelligent systems, provide a baseline level of complexity for user understanding, and highlight the challenges of making users aware of sensed inputs for such systems."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "Coordinating joint activity in avatar-mediated interaction", "author": "Robert J.

Although MMOGs take face-to-face conversation as their metaphor for user-to-user interaction, avatars currently give off much less information about what users are doing than real human bodies. Consequently, users routinely encounter slippages in coordination when engaging in joint courses of action. In this study, we analyze screen-capture video of user-to-user interaction in the game, City of Heroes, under two conditions: one with the game's standard awareness cues and the other with enhanced cues. We use conversation analysis to demonstrate interactional slippages caused by the absence of awareness cues, user practices that circumvent such limitations and ways in which enhanced cues can enable tighter coordination."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "Improving recognition and characterization in groupware with rich embodiments", "author": "Tadeusz Stach and Carl Gutwin and David Pinelle and Pourang Irani", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240627", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240627", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Stach_2007", "abstract": "Embodiments are visual representations of people in a groupware system. Embodiments convey awareness information such as presence, location, and movement -- but they provide far less information than what is available from a real body in a face-to-face setting. As a result, it is often difficult to recognize and characterize other people in a groupware system without extensive communication. To address this problem, information-rich embodiments use ideas from multivariate information visualization to maximize the amount of information that is represented about a person. To investigate the feasibility of rich embodiment and their effects on group interaction, we carried out three studies. The first shows that users are able to recall and interpret a large set of variables that are graphically encoded on an embodiment. The second and third studies demonstrated rich embodiments in two groupware systems -- a multiplayer game and a drawing application -- and showed that the enhanced representations do improve recognition and characterization, and that they can enrich interaction in a variety of ways."}, {"booktitle": "Proceedings of the {SIGCHI} Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems  - {CHI} {\\textquotesingle}07", "title": "A meta-analysis of the impact of the inclusion and realism of human-like faces on user experiences in interfaces", "author": "Nick Yee and Jeremy N Bailenson and Kathryn Rickertsen", "publisher": "{ACM} Press", "year": "2007", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145%2F1240624.1240626", "doi": "10.1145/1240624.1240626", "ENTRYTYPE": "inproceedings", "ID": "Yee_2007", "abstract": "The use of embodied agents, defined as visual human-like representations accompanying a computer interface, is becoming prevalent in applications ranging from educational software to advertisements. In the current work, we assimilate previous empirical studies which compare interfaces with visually embodied agents to interfaces without agents, both using an informal, descriptive technique based on experimental results (46 studies) as well as a formal statistical meta-analysis (25 studies). Results revealed significantly larger effect sizes when analyzing subjective responses (i.e., questionnaire ratings, interviews) than when analyzing behavioral responses such as task performance and memory. Furthermore, the effects of adding an agent to an interface are larger than the effects of animating an agent to behave more realistically. However, the overall effect sizes were quite small (e.g., across studies, adding a face to an interface only explains approximately 2.5% of the variance in results). We discuss the implications for both designers building interfaces as well as social scientists designing experiments to evaluate those interfaces."}]
