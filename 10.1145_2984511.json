        "abstract": "A projector manipulates outgoing light rays, while a camera records incoming ones. Combining these optically inverse devices, especially in a coaxial manner, creates the possibility of a new computer-vision technology. The \"Smart Headlight,\" currently under development at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, is one example: a device that can \"erase\" raindrops or snowflakes from a driver's sight, allowing for continuous use of the \"high beams\" mode while not causing glare against oncoming drivers, and enhance the appearance of important objects, such as pedestrians. In that sense, it constitutes a \"genuine\" augmented reality, manipulating the reality for how it appears to a viewer, rather than merely overlaying objects on the image of the reality. This talk will present the state of the Smart Headlight project and discuss further possible applications of projector-camera systems."

        "abstract": "Touch screens have a delay between user input and corresponding visual interface feedback, called input 'latency' (or 'lag'). Visual latency is more noticeable during continuous input actions like dragging, so methods to display feedback based on the most likely path for the next few input points have been described in research papers and patents. Designing these 'next-point prediction' methods is challenging, and there have been no standard metrics to compare different approaches. We introduce metrics to quantify the probability of 7 spatial error 'side-effects' caused by next-point prediction methods. Types of side-effects are derived using a thematic analysis of comments gathered in a 12 participants study covering drawing, dragging, and panning tasks using 5 state-of-the-art next-point predictors. Using experiment logs of actual and predicted input points, we develop quantitative metrics that correlate positively with the frequency of perceived side-effects. These metrics enable practitioners to compare next-point predictors using only input logs."

        "abstract": "For glass-free mixed reality (MR), mid-air imaging is a promising way of superimposing a virtual image onto a real object. We focus on attaching virtual images to non-static real life objects. In previous work, moving the real object causes latency in the superimposing system, and the virtual image seems to follow the object with a delay. This is caused by delays due to sensors, displays and computational devices for position sensing, and occasionally actuators for moving the image generation source. In order to avoid this problem, this paper proposes to separate the object-anchored imaging effect from the position sensing. Our proposal is a retro-reflective system called \"SkyAnchor,\" which consists of only optical devices: two mirrors and an aerial-imaging plate. The system reflects light from a light source anchored under the physical object itself, and forms an image anchored around the object. This optical solution does not cause any latency in principle and is effective for high-quality mixed reality applications. We consider two types of light sources to be attached to physical objects: reflecting content from a touch table on which the object rests, or attaching the source directly on the object. As for position sensing, we utilize a capacitive marker on the bottom of the object, tracked on a touch table. We have implemented a prototype, where mid-air images move with the object, and whose content may change based on its position."

However, such dynamics are challenging to produce, as manually sketching key-frames requires significant effort and artistic expertise while physical simulation tools lack sufficient expressiveness and user control. We present an interactive interface for designing these elemental dynamics for animated illustrations. Users draw with coarse-scale energy brushes which serve as control gestures to drive detailed flow particles which represent local velocity fields. These fields can convey both realistic and artistic effects based on user specification. This painting metaphor for creating elemental dynamics simplifies the process, providing artistic control, and preserves the fluidity of sketching. Our system is fast, stable, and intuitive. An initial user evaluation shows that even novice users with no prior animation experience can create intriguing dynamics using our system."

Our findings suggest that mobile fabrication is a compelling next direction for personal fabrication. From our experience with the prototypes we derive hardware requirements to make mobile fabrication also technically feasible."

To address this challenge, we developed DriftBoard, a panning-based text entry technique where the user types by positioning a movable qwerty keyboard on an interactive area with respect to a fixed cursor point. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of DriftBoard and report results of a user study on a watch-size touchscreen. The study compared DriftBoard to two ultra-small keyboards, ZoomBoard (tapping-based) and Swipeboard (swiping-based). DriftBoard performed comparably (no significant difference) to ZoomBoard in the major metrics of text entry speed and error rate, and outperformed Swipeboard, which suggests that panning-based typing is a promising input method for text entry on ultra-small touchscreens."

We conjecture that a firm contact may not be always possible and acceptable. Therefore, we explored the concept of a non-contact wearable tactile display using an airflow, which can transfer information without a firm contact. To secure an empirical ground for the design of a wearable airflow display, we conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to estimate the intensity thresholds, duration thresholds, and distance thresholds of airflow perception on various body locations, and report the resulting empirical data in this paper. We then built a 4-point airflow display, compared its performance with that of a vibrotactile display, and could show that the two tactile displays are comparable in information transfer performance. User feedback was also positive and revealed many unique expressions describing airflow-based tactile experiences. Lastly, we demonstrate the feasibility of an airflow-based wearable tactile display with a prototype using micro-fans."

To enable data-driven app design applications, we present interaction mining -- capturing both static (UI layouts, visual details) and dynamic (user flows, motion details) components of an app's design. We present ERICA, a system that takes a scalable, human-computer approach to interaction mining existing Android apps without the need to modify them in any way. As users interact with apps through ERICA, it detects UI changes, seamlessly records multiple data-streams in the background, and unifies them into a user interaction trace. Using ERICA we collected interaction traces from over a thousand popular Android apps. Leveraging this trace data, we built machine learning classifiers to detect elements and layouts indicative of 23 common user flows. User flows are an important component of UX design and consists of a sequence of UI states that represent semantically meaningful tasks such as searching or composing. With these classifiers, we identified and indexed more than 3000 flow examples, and released the largest online search engine of user flows in Android apps."

Most return minimally interactive visualizations in response to queries and often require experts to perform modeling for a set of predicted user queries before the systems are effective. Eviza provides a natural language interface for an interactive query dialog with an existing visualization rather than starting from a blank sheet and asking closed-ended questions that return a single text answer or static visualization. The system employs a probabilistic grammar based approach with predefined rules that are dynamically updated based on the data from the visualization, as opposed to computationally intensive deep learning or knowledge based approaches."

        "abstract": "Prior work on creativity support tools demonstrates how a computational semantic model of a solution space can enable interventions that substantially improve the number, quality and diversity of ideas. However, automated semantic modeling often falls short when people contribute short text snippets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large number of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IdeaHound, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of defining semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational semantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IDEAHOUND to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already motivated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IDEAHOUND compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate semantic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and providing a visual overview of the solution space."

Their position on the wrist makes them ideal for capturing bio-acoustic signals. We developed a custom smartwatch kernel that boosts the sampling rate of a smartwatch's existing accelerometer to 4 kHz. Using this new source of high-fidelity data, we uncovered a wide range of applications. For example, we can use bio-acoustic data to classify hand gestures such as flicks, claps, scratches, and taps, which combine with on-device motion tracking to create a wide range of expressive input modalities. Bio-acoustic sensing can also detect the vibrations of grasped mechanical or motor-powered objects, enabling passive object recognition that can augment everyday experiences with context-aware functionality. Finally, we can generate structured vibrations using a transducer, and show that data can be transmitted through the human body. Overall, our contributions unlock user interface techniques that previously relied on special-purpose and/or cumbersome instrumentation, making such interactions considerably more feasible for inclusion in future consumer devices."

We created StickyLines, a tool that treats guidelines as first-class objects: Users can create precise, predictable and persistent interactive alignment and distribution relationships, and 'tweaked' positions can be maintained for subsequent interactions. We ran a [2x2] within-participant experiment to compare StickyLines with standard commands, with two levels of layout difficulty. StickyLines performed 40% faster and required 49% fewer actions than traditional alignment and distribution commands for complex layouts. In study three, six professional designers quickly adopted StickyLines and identified novel uses, including creating complex compound guidelines and using them for both spatial and semantic grouping."

In the first study we measured the precision of FaceTouch in a display-fixed target selection task using three different selection techniques showing a low error rate of 2% indicate the viability for everyday usage. To asses the impact of different mounting positions on the user performance we conducted a second study. We compared three mounting positions of the touchpad (face, hand and side) showing that mounting the touchpad at the back of the HMD resulted in a significantly lower error rate, lower selection time and higher usability. Finally, we present interaction techniques and three example applications that explore the FaceTouch design space."

We introduce a new system that offers improved sampling speed and resolution. In turn, this enables superior interior reconstruction and gesture recognition. More importantly, we use our new system as a vehicle for experimentation ' we compare two EIT sensing methods and three different electrode resolutions. Results from in-depth empirical evaluations and a user study shed light on the future feasibility of EIT for sensing human input."

In this paper, we use polylingual topic modeling to learn latent fashion concepts jointly in two languages capturing these elements and styles. Using this latent topic formation we can translate between these two languages through topic space, exposing the elements of fashion style. We train the polylingual topic model (PLTM) on a set of more than half a million outfits collected from Polyvore, a popular fashion-based social net- work. We present novel, data-driven fashion applications that allow users to express their needs in natural language just as they would to a real stylist and produce tailored item recommendations for these style needs."

Existing tools provide affordances to analyze source code, but feature-rich websites reveal tens of thousands of lines of code and can easily overwhelm the user. We thus present Telescope, a platform for discovering how JavaScript and HTML support a website interaction. Telescope helps users understand unfamiliar website code through a composite view they control by adjusting JavaScript detail, scoping the runtime timeline, and triggering relational links between JS, HTML, and website components. To support these affordances on the open web, Telescope instruments the JavaScript in a website without request intercepts using a novel sleight-of-hand technique, then watches for traces emitted from the website. In a case study across seven popular websites, Telescope helped identify less than 150 lines of front-end code out of tens of thousands that accurately describe the desired interaction in six of the sites. In an exploratory user study, we observed users identifying difficult programming concepts by developing strategies to analyze relatively small amounts of unfamiliar website source code with Telescope."

QuickCut takes an audio recording of the narration voiceover and a collection of raw video footage as input. Users then review the raw footage and provide spoken annotations describing the relevant actions and objects in the scene. QuickCut time-aligns a transcript of the annotations with the raw footage and a transcript of the narration to the voiceover. These aligned transcripts enable authors to quickly match story events in the narration with semantically relevant video segments and form alignment constraints between them. Given a set of such constraints, QuickCut applies dynamic programming optimization to choose frame-level cut points between the video segments while maintaining alignments with the narration and adhering to low-level film editing guidelines. We demonstrate QuickCut's effectiveness by using it to generate a variety of short (less than 2 minutes) narrated videos. Each result required between 14 and 52 minutes of user time to edit (i.e. between 8 and 31 minutes for each minute of output video), which is far less than typical authoring times with existing video editing workflows."

To explore how this sensing approach could enhance smartwatch interactions, we considered different antenna configurations and how they could enable useful interaction modalities. We identified four configurations that can support six well-known modalities of particular interest and utility, including gestures above or in close proximity to watches, and touchscreen-like finger tracking on the skin. We quantify the feasibility of these input modalities, suggesting that AuraSense can be low latency and robust across users and environments."

This paper presents a novel debugging tool for electronic design projects, the Toastboard, that aims to reduce debugging time by improving upon the standard paradigm of point-wise circuit measurements. Ubiquitous instrumentation allows for immediate visualization of an entire breadboard's state, meaning users can diagnose problems based on a wealth of data instead of having to form a single hypothesis and plan before taking a measurement. Basic connectivity information is displayed visually on the circuit itself and quantitative data is displayed on the accompanying web interface. Software-based testing functions further lower the expertise threshold for efficient debugging by diagnosing classes of circuit errors automatically. In an informal study, participants found the detailed, pervasive, and context-rich data from our tool helpful and potentially time-saving."

We focus on high-frequency (60]GHz), short-range radar based sensing, in particular Google's Soli sensor. The signal has unique properties such as resolving motion at a very fine level and allowing for segmentation in range and velocity spaces rather than image space. This enables recognition of new types of inputs but poses significant difficulties for the design of input recognition algorithms. The proposed algorithm is capable of detecting a rich set of dynamic gestures and can resolve small motions of fingers in fine detail. Our technique is based on an end-to-end trained combination of deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The algorithm achieves high recognition rates (avg 87%) on a challenging set of 11 dynamic gestures and generalizes well across 10 users. The proposed model runs on commodity hardware at 140 Hz (CPU only)."

Based on the analysis of design practices and drawing skills in the art and design literature, we suggest novel ideas for efficiently acquiring hand postures (palm-pinning widget, front and center mirrors, responsive spangles), for quickly creating and easily adjusting sketch planes (modified tick-triggered, orientable and shiftable sketch planes), for appropriately starting 3D sketching products with hand information (hand skeleton, grip axis), and for practically increasing user throughput (intensifier, rough and precise erasers)---all of which are coherently and consistently integrated in our system. A user test by ten industrial design students and an in-depth discussion show that our system is both useful and usable in designing handheld products."

Through a user study, we examine the impact of performing 8 distinct gestures (4 directional marks, and 4 free-form shapes) on the stability of the watch surface. Participants were able to perform directional marks using the wrist as a joystick at an average rate of half a second and free-form shapes at an average rate of approximately 1.5secs. The free-form shapes could be recognized by a $1 gesture recognizer with an accuracy of 93.8% and by three human inspectors with an accuracy of 85%. From these results, we designed and implemented a proof-of-concept device by augmenting the watchband using an array of proximity sensors, which can be used to draw gestures with high quality. Finally, we demonstrate a number of scenarios that benefit from one-handed continuous input on smartwatches using WristWhirl."

Based on this sequence, a series of illustrations is automatically generated using a stylistically rendered 3D avatar annotated with arrows to convey movements. During demonstration, the user can navigate using speech and amend or re-perform motions if needed. Once a suitable sequence of steps has been created, a Refinement Interface enables fine control of visualization parameters.

Our goal is to \"recycle\" users' otherwise-unused gesture variation to create rich output under the users' control, without sacrificing accuracy. Experiment 1 reveals a high level of existing gesture variation, even for accurate text, and shows that users can consciously vary their gestures under different conditions. We designed an Expressive Keyboard for a smart phone which maps input gesture features identified in Experiment 1 to a continuous output parameter space, i.e. RGB color. Experiment 2 shows that users can consciously modify their gestures, while retaining accuracy, to generate specific colors as they gesture-type. Users are more successful when they focus on output characteristics (such as red) rather than input characteristics (such as curviness). We designed an app with a dynamic font engine that continuously interpolates between several typefaces, as well as controlling weight and random variation. Experiment 3 shows that, in the context of a more ecologically-valid conversation task, users enjoy generating multiple forms of rich output. We conclude with suggestions for how the Expressive Keyboard approach can enhance a wide variety of gesture recognition applications."

Electrical connections are engraved in the surface, eliminating the need for wiring individual parts. We consider our work as complementary to current shape-changing interfaces.

        "abstract": "The lack of dedicated multitasking interface features in smartphones has resulted in users attempting a sequential form of multitasking via frequent app switching. In addition to the obvious temporal cost, it requires physical and cognitive effort which increases multifold as the back and forth switching becomes more frequent. We propose porous interfaces, a paradigm that combines the concept of translucent windows with finger identification to support efficient multitasking on small screens. Porous interfaces enable partially transparent app windows overlaid on top of each other, each of them being accessible simultaneously using a different finger as input. We design porous interfaces to include a broad range of multitasking interactions with and between windows, while ensuring fidelity with the existing smartphone interactions. We develop an end-to-end smartphone interface that demonstrates porous interfaces. In a qualitative study, participants found porous interfaces intuitive, easy, and useful for frequent multitasking scenarios."

        "abstract": "Speech recordings are central to modern media from podcasts to audio books to e-lectures and voice-overs. Authoring these recordings involves an iterative back and forth process between script writing/editing and audio recording/editing. Yet, most existing tools treat the script and the audio separately, making the back and forth workflow very tedious. We present Voice Script, an interface to support a dynamic workflow for script writing and audio recording/editing. Our system integrates the script with the audio such that, as the user writes the script or records speech, edits to the script are translated to the audio and vice versa. Through informal user studies, we demonstrate that our interface greatly facilitates the audio authoring process in various scenarios."

        "abstract": "Video production is a collaborative process in which stakeholders regularly review drafts of the edited video to indicate problems and offer suggestions for improvement. Although practitioners prefer in-person feedback, most reviews are conducted asynchronously via email due to scheduling and location constraints. The use of this impoverished medium is challenging for both providers and consumers of feedback. We introduce VidCrit, a system for providing asynchronous feedback on drafts of edited video that incorporates favorable qualities of an in-person review. This system consists of two separate interfaces: (1) A feedback recording interface captures reviewers' spoken comments, mouse interactions, hand gestures and other physical reactions. (2) A feedback viewing interface transcribes and segments the recorded review into topical comments so that the video author can browse the review by either text or timelines. Our system features novel methods to automatically segment a long review session into topical text comments, and to label such comments with additional contextual information. We interviewed practitioners to inform a set of design guidelines for giving and receiving feedback, and based our system's design on these guidelines. Video reviewers using our system preferred our feedback recording interface over email for providing feedback due to the reduction in time and effort. In a fixed amount of time, reviewers provided 10.9 (\u03c3=5.09) more local comments than when using text. All video authors rated our feedback viewing interface preferable to receiving feedback via e-mail."

Vision conditions like presbyopia that result in blurry near vision make reading small text particularly hard. We design multiple different scripts for displaying English text, legible at small sizes even when blurry, for small screens such as smartphones and smartwatches. These \"smartfonts\" redesign visual character presentations to improve the reading experience. Like cursive, Grade 1 Braille, and ordinary fonts, they preserve orthography and spelling. They have the potential to enable people to read more text comfortably on small screens, e.g., without reading glasses. To simulate presbyopia, we blur images and evaluate their legibility using paid crowdsourcing. We also evaluate the difficulty of learning to read smartfonts and observe a learnability/legibility trade-off. Our most learnable smartfont can be read at roughly half the speed of Latin after two thousand practice sentences. It is also legible smaller than half the size of traditional Latin (i.e. \"English\") when blurry."

Mavo extends the declarative syntax of HTML to describe Web applications that manage, store and transform data. Using Mavo, authors with basic HTML knowledge define complex data schemas implicitly as they design their HTML layout. They need only add a few attributes and expressions to their HTML elements to transform their static design into a persistent, data-driven web application whose data can be edited by direct manipulation of the content in the browser. We evaluated Mavo with 20 users who marked up static designs---some provided by us, some their own creation---to transform them into fully functional web applications.

Despite its importance, there has been little theoretical work on creating such models. Building on the Dual Gaussian Distribution Model[3], we derived an accuracy model that predicts the success rate of target acquisition based on the target size. We evaluated the model by comparing the predicted success rates with empirical measures for three types of targets including 1-dimensional vertical and horizontal, and 2-dimensional circular targets. The predictions matched the empirical data very well: the differences between predicted and observed success rates were under 5% for 4.8 mm and 7.2 mm targets, and under 10% for 2.4 mm targets. The evaluation results suggest that our simple model can reliably predict touch accuracy."

We propose a novel model of crowdsourced fabrication, in which a large number of workers and volunteers are guided through the process of building a pre-designed structure. The process is facilitated by an intelligent construction space capable of guiding individual workers and coordinating the overall build process. More specifically, we explore the use of smartwatches, indoor location sensing, and instrumented construction materials to provide real-time guidance to workers, coordinated by a foreman engine that manages the overall build process. We report on a three day deployment of our system to construct a 12-tall bamboo pavilion with assistance from more than one hundred volunteer workers, and reflect on observations and feedback collected during the exhibit."

To achieve such a level of reality, it is essential to reproduce the three-dimensional (3D) shape and material appearances simultaneously; however, to date, developing a display that can satisfy both conditions has been difficult. To address this problem, we propose a system that places physical elements at desired locations to create a visual image that is perceivable by the naked eye. This configuration can be realized by exploiting characteristics of human visual perception. Humans perceive light modulation as perfectly steady light if the modulation rate is sufficiently high. Therefore, if high-speed spatially varying illumination is projected to the actuated physical elements possessing various appearances at the desired timing, a realistic visual image that can be transformed dynamically by simply modifying the lighting pattern can be obtained. We call the proposed display technology Phyxel. This paper describes the proposed configuration and required performance for Phyxel. We also demonstrate three applications: dynamic stop motion, a layered 3D display, and shape mixture."

Moreover, the concept of gameplay itself is difficult to define and quantify. In this paper, we show that analyzing players' controller inputs using probabilistic topic models allows game developers to describe the types of gameplay -- or action -- in games in a quantitative way. More specifically, developers can discover the types of action that a game fosters and the extent that each game level fosters each type of action, all in an unsupervised manner. They can use this information to verify that their levels feature the appropriate style of gameplay and to recommend levels with gameplay that is similar to levels that players like. We begin with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the simplest topic model, then develop the player-gameplay action (PGA) model to make the same types of discoveries about gameplay in a way that is independent of each player's play style. We train a player recognition system on the PGA model's output to verify that its discoveries about gameplay are in fact independent of each player's play style. The system recognizes players with over 90% accuracy in about 20 seconds of playtime."

The aim is to create a more engaging experience when writing on touch surfaces, such as screens of tablet computers. This is achieved by regenerating the friction-induced oscillation and sound of a real writing tool in contact with paper. To generate realistic tactile feedback, our algorithm analyzes the frequency spectrum of the friction oscillation generated when writing with traditional tools, extracts principal frequencies, and uses the actuator's frequency response profile for an adjustment weighting function. We enhance the realism by providing the sound feedback aligned with the writing pressure and speed. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of superposition and fluctuation of several frequencies on human tactile perception, evaluated the performance of RealPen, and characterized users' perception and preference of each feedback type."

Unlike existing navigation systems that require users to recognize information and then follow directions as two separate, conscious processes, the proposed method guides users without them needing to pay attention to the information provided by the navigation system and also allows them to be graphically manipulated by controllers. In the proposed system, users perceive the real world by means of stereo images provided by a stereo camera and the HMD. Specifically, while walking, the navigation system provides users with real-time feedback by processing the images they have just perceived and giving them visual stimuli. This study examined two image-processing methods for manipulation of human's walking direction: moving stripe pattern and changing focal region. Experimental results indicate that the changing focal region method most effectively leads walkers as it changes their walking path by approximately 200 mm/m on average."

In particular, body tapping has been previously proposed as a technique that allows the user to quickly access a target functionality by simply tapping at a specific location of the body with a smartphone. Though compelling, prior work often fell short in enabling users' unconstrained tapping locations or behaviors. To address this problem, we developed a novel recognition method that combines both offline-before the system sees any user-defined gestures and online learning to reliably recognize arbitrary, user-defined body tapping gestures, only using a smartphone's built-in sensors. Our experiment indicates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in several usage conditions. In particular, provided only with a single sample per location, our accuracy is 30.8% over an SVM baseline and 24.8% over a template matching method. Based on these findings, we discuss how our approach can be generalized to other user-defined gesture problems."

To address this problem, we present CodeMend, a system to support finding and integration of code. CodeMend leverages a neural embedding model to jointly model natural language and code as mined from large Web and code datasets. We also demonstrate a novel, mixed-initiative, interface to support query and integration steps. Through CodeMend, end-users describe their goal in natural language. The system makes salient the relevant API functions, the lines in the end-user's program that should be changed, as well as proposing the actual change. We demonstrate the utility and accuracy of CodeMend through lab and simulation studies."

        "abstract": "Gaze is frequently explored in public display research given its importance for monitoring and analysing audience attention. However, current gaze-enabled public display interfaces require either special-purpose eye tracking equipment or explicit personal calibration for each individual user. We present AggreGaze, a novel method for estimating spatio-temporal audience attention on public displays. Our method requires only a single off-the-shelf camera attached to the display, does not require any personal calibration, and provides visual attention estimates across the full display. We achieve this by 1) compensating for errors of state-of-the-art appearance-based gaze estimation methods through on-site training data collection, and by 2) aggregating uncalibrated and thus inaccurate gaze estimates of multiple users into joint attention estimates. We propose different visual stimuli for this compensation: a standard 9-point calibration, moving targets, text and visual stimuli embedded into the display content, as well as normal video content. Based on a two-week deployment in a public space, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for estimating attention maps that closely resemble ground-truth audience gaze distributions."

        "abstract": "An interactive method for segmentation and isosurface extraction of medical volume data is proposed. In conventional methods, users decompose a volume into multiple regions iteratively, segment each region using a threshold, and then manually clean the segmentation result by removing clutter in each region. However, this is tedious and requires many mouse operations from different camera views. We propose an alternative approach whereby the user simply applies painting operations to the volume using tools commonly seen in painting systems, such as flood fill and brushes. This significantly reduces the number of mouse and camera control operations. Our technical contribution is in the introduction of the threshold field, which assigns spatially-varying threshold values to individual voxels. This generalizes discrete decomposition of a volume into regions and segmentation using a constant threshold in each region, thereby offering a much more flexible and efficient workflow. This paper describes the details of the user interaction and its implementation. Furthermore, the results of a user study are discussed. The results indicate that the proposed method can be a few times faster than a conventional method."

However, saving information is challenging on mobile devices, where the small screen and font sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use. Furthermore, beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text on a mobile device, in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the user. In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster, we introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context of saving information during complex reading and information exploration. We embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes along with posthoc expandable context to support identifying and saving information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices. In a two part user study we find that this approach reduced selection time and was preferred by participants over the default system text selection method."

We simulate those kinesthetic forces by attaching flywheels to the users head, leveraging the gyroscopic effect of resistance when changing the spinning axis of rotation. GyroVR is an ungrounded, wireless and self contained device allowing the user to freely move inside the virtual environment. The generic shape allows to attach it to different positions on the users body. We evaluated the impact of GyroVR onto different mounting positions on the head (back and front) in terms of immersion, enjoyment and simulator sickness. Our results show, that attaching GyroVR onto the users head (front of the Head Mounted Display (HMD)) resulted in the highest level of immersion and enjoyment and therefore can be built into future VR HMDs, enabling kinesthetic forces in VR."

Meta functions are shareable via URL and instrumented to record runtime data. Combining thousands of Meta functions with their collective runtime data, we demonstrate tools including an optimizer that replaces your function with a more efficient version written by someone else, an auto-patcher that saves your program from crashing by finding equivalent functions in the community, and a proactive linter that warns you when a function fails elsewhere in the community. We find that professional programmers are able to use Meta for complex tasks (creating new Meta functions that, for example, cross-validate a logistic regression), and that Meta is able to find 44 optimizations (for a 1.45 times average speedup) and 5 bug fixes across the crowd."

In two experiments, we show that our two proof-of-concept apps, ZenWalk and Zombies Interactive, compare favorably to their non-data collecting counterparts, and that we can effectively extract environmental data using simple detection techniques."

This concept merges manual and digital procedures, and imports parametric design tools into cooking, allowing the chef to personalize the tastes, flavors, structures and aesthetics of dishes.

These inflated scores, which make high-quality work and workers difficult to find, stem from social pressure to avoid giving negative feedback. We introduce Boomerang, a reputation system for crowdsourcing platforms that elicits more accurate feedback by rebounding the consequences of feedback directly back onto the person who gave it. With Boomerang, requesters find that their highly-rated workers gain earliest access to their future tasks, and workers find tasks from their highly-rated requesters at the top of their task feed. Field experiments verify that Boomerang causes both workers and requesters to provide feedback that is more closely aligned with their private opinions. Inspired by a game-theoretic notion of incentive-compatibility, Boomerang opens opportunities for interaction design to incentivize honest reporting over strategic dishonesty."

We demonstrate two such controllers, NormalTouch and TextureTouch, which are tracked in 3D and produce spatially-registered haptic feedback to a user's finger. NormalTouch haptically renders object surfaces and provides force feedback using a tiltable and extrudable platform. TextureTouch renders the shape of virtual objects including detailed surface structure through a 4\u00d74 matrix of actuated pins. By moving our controllers around while keeping their finger on the actuated platform, users obtain the impression of a much larger 3D shape by cognitively integrating output sensations over time. Our evaluation compares the effectiveness of our controllers with the two de-facto standards in Virtual Reality controllers: device vibration and visual feedback only. We find that haptic feedback significantly increases the accuracy of VR interaction, most effectively by rendering high-fidelity shape output as in the case of our controllers."

In this paper we introduce a novel technique called gesture path stochastic resampling (GPSR) that is computationally efficient, has minimal coding overhead, and yet despite its simplicity is able to achieve higher accuracy than competitive, state-of-the-art approaches. GPSR generates synthetic samples by lengthening and shortening gesture subpaths within a given sample to produce realistic variations of the input via a process of nonuniform resampling. As such, GPSR is an appropriate rapid prototyping technique where ease of use, understandability, and efficiency are key. Further, through an extensive evaluation, we show that accuracy significantly improves when gesture recognizers are trained with GPSR synthetic samples. In some cases, mean recognition errors are reduced by more than 70%, and in most cases, GPSR outperforms two other evaluated state-of-the-art methods."

At the heart of this printer is a mechanism for depositing wire within a five degree of freedom (5DOF) fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. Copper wire can be used with this mechanism to form coils which induce magnetic fields as a current is passed through them. Soft iron wire can additionally be used to form components with high magnetic permeability which are thus able to shape and direct these magnetic fields to where they are needed. When fabricated with structural plastic elements, this allows simple but complete custom electromagnetic devices to be 3D printed. As examples, we demonstrate the fabrication of a solenoid actuator for the arm of a Lucky Cat figurine, a 6-pole motor stepper stator, a reluctance motor rotor and a Ferrofluid display. In addition, we show how printed coils which generate small currents in response to user actions can be used as input sensors in interactive devices."

        "abstract": "We present HoloFlex, a 3D flexible smartphone featuring a light-field display consisting of a high-resolution P-OLED display and an array of 16,640 microlenses. HoloFlex allows mobile users to interact with 3D images featuring natural visual cues such as motion parallax and stereoscopy without glasses or head tracking. Its flexibility allows the use of bend input for interacting with 3D objects along the z axis. Images are rendered into 12-pixel wide circular blocks-pinhole views of the 3D scene-which enable ~80 unique viewports at an effective resolution of 160 \u00d7 104. The microlens array distributes each pixel from the display in a direction that preserves the angular information of light rays in the 3D scene. We present a preliminary study evaluating the effect of bend input vs. a vertical touch screen slider on 3D docking performance. Results indicate that bend input significantly improves movement time in this task. We also present 3D applications including a 3D editor, a 3D Angry Birds game and a 3D teleconferencing system that utilize bend input."

        "abstract": "This paper presents EdgeVib, a system of spatiotemporal vibration patterns for delivering alphanumeric characters on wrist-worn vibrotactile displays. We first investigated spatiotemporal pattern delivery through a watch-back tactile display by performing a series of user studies. The results reveal that employing a 2\u00d72 vibrotactile array is more effective than employing a 3\u00d73 one, because the lower-resolution array creates clearer tactile sensations in less time consumption. We then deployed EdgeWrite patterns on a 2\u00d72 vibrotactile array to determine any difficulties of delivering alphanumerical characters, and then modified the unistroke patterns into multistroke EdgeVib ones on the basis of the findings. The results of a 24-participant user study reveal that the recognition rates of the modified multistroke patterns were significantly higher than the original unistroke ones in both alphabet (85.9% vs. 70.7%) and digits (88.6% vs. 78.5%) delivery, and a further study indicated that the techniques can be generalized to deliver two-character compound messages with recognition rates higher than 83.3%. The guidelines derived from our study can be used for designing watch-back tactile displays for alphanumeric character output."

While existing diving simulators mostly focus on visual and aural displays, Amphibian simulates a wider variety of sensations experienced underwater. Users rest their torso on a motion platform to feel buoyancy. Their outstretched arms and legs are placed in a suspended harness to simulate drag as they swim. An Oculus Rift head-mounted display (HMD) and a pair of headphones delineate the visual and auditory ocean scene. Additional senses simulated in Amphibian are breath motion, temperature changes, and tactile feedback through various sensors. Twelve experienced divers compared Amphibian to real-life scuba diving. We analyzed the system factors that influenced the users' sense of being there while using our simulator. We present future UI improvements for enhancing immersion in VR diving simulators."

We show a range of fabrication methods, from manual sealing, to heat pressing with custom stencils and a custom heat-sealing head that can be mounted on usual 3-axis CNC machines to precisely fabricate the designed transforming material. Finally, we present three applications to show how this technology could be used for designing interactive wearables, toys, and furniture."

When holding the device, the free thumb is normally limited in reach, but can provide an opportunity for indirect touch input. Here we propose gaze and touch input, where touches redirect to the gaze target. This provides whole-screen reachability while only using a single hand for both holding and input. We present a user study comparing this technique to direct-touch, showing that users are slightly slower but can utilise one-handed use with less physical effort. To enable interaction with small targets, we introduce CursorShift, a method that uses gaze to provide users temporal control over cursors during direct-touch interactions. Taken together, users can employ three techniques on tablets: direct-touch, gaze and touch, and cursor input. In three applications, we explore how these techniques can coexist in the same UI and demonstrate how tablet tasks can be performed with thumb-only input of the holding hand, and with it describe novel interaction techniques for gaze based tablet interaction."

Based on established research designs, we report on the results of three studies, first with 26 materials (including complex composite objects), next with 16 transparent materials (with different thickness and varying dyes) and finally 10 body parts from 6 participants. Both leave one-out and 10-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our approach of classification of radar signals using random forest classifier is robust and accurate. We further demonstrate four working examples including a physical object dictionary, painting and photo editing application, body shortcuts and automatic refill based on RadarCat. We conclude with a discussion of our results, limitations and outline future directions."

        "abstract": "We demonstrate a new approach for designing functional material definitions for multi-material fabrication using our system called Foundry. Foundry provides an interactive and visual process for hierarchically designing spatially-varying material properties (e.g., appearance, mechanical, optical). The resulting meta-materials exhibit structure at the micro and macro level and can surpass the qualities of traditional composites. The material definitions are created by composing a set of operators into an operator graph. Each operator performs a volume decomposition operation, remaps space, or constructs and assigns a material composition. The operators are implemented using a domain-specific language for multi-material fabrication; users can easily extend the library by writing their own operators. Foundry can be used to build operator graphs that describe complex, parameterized, resolution-independent, and reusable material definitions. We also describe how to stage the evaluation of the final material definition which in conjunction with progressive refinement, allows for interactive material evaluation even for complex designs. We show sophisticated and functional parts designed with our system."

        "abstract": "The world is full of physical interfaces that are inaccessible to blind people, from microwaves and information kiosks to thermostats and checkout terminals. Blind people cannot independently use such devices without at least first learning their layout, and usually only after labeling them with sighted assistance. We introduce VizLens - an accessible mobile application and supporting backend that can robustly and interactively help blind people use nearly any interface they encounter. VizLens users capture a photo of an inaccessible interface and send it to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface to make subsequent computer vision easier. The VizLens application helps users recapture the interface in the field of the camera, and uses computer vision to interactively describe the part of the interface beneath their finger (updating 8 times per second). We show that VizLens provides accurate and usable real-time feedback in a study with 10 blind participants, and our crowdsourcing labeling workflow was fast (8 minutes), accurate (99.7%), and cheap ($1.15). We then explore extensions of VizLens that allow it to (i) adapt to state changes in dynamic interfaces, (ii) combine crowd labeling with OCR technology to handle dynamic displays, and (iii) benefit from head-mounted cameras. VizLens robustly solves a long-standing challenge in accessibility by deeply integrating crowdsourcing and computer vision, and foreshadows a future of increasingly powerful interactive applications that would be currently impossible with either alone."

We use Polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) as the base material for a Stretchi and show how to embed stretchable touch and proximity sensors and stretchable electroluminescent displays. Stretchis can be ultra-thin (\u2248 200\u03bcm), flexible, and fully customizable, enabling non-expert makers to add interaction to elastic physical objects, shape-changing surfaces, fabrics, and the human body. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with three application examples that range from ubiquitous computing to wearables and on-skin interaction."

Our system demonstrates high-quality, real-time 3D reconstructions of an entire space, including people, furniture and objects, using a set of new depth cameras. These 3D models can also be transmitted in real-time to remote users. This allows users wearing virtual or augmented reality displays to see, hear and interact with remote participants in 3D, almost as if they were present in the same physical space. From an audio-visual perspective, communicating and interacting with remote users edges closer to face-to-face communication. This paper describes the Holoportation technical system in full, its key interactive capabilities, the application scenarios it enables, and an initial qualitative study of using this new communication medium."
